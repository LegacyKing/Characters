Orion Fowl,

A man of integrity and a moral code of ethics and strong honor. Motivated to follow his code of honor.
#2 - I honestly haven't thought about it. That's a moving target to be honest...
#3 - He avoids anything he considers evil - Taking a life in cold blood and such.
#4 - I haven't come up with any... or have I?

Orion Fowl is an Illan, a secretive race so closely related to humans, nobody can really tell them apart. He decided to go into the world of 'men' to learn more about them and see how the world really works. He would like to grow in power, both as a protector to his people and to pass on knowledge to a family he desires to start. If he gains enough prestige, land and titles, he would like to make a realm where his people would be safe, to pursue their way of life.

Not sure what else you'd like about him. No traumatic back stories, he's had adventures but nothing worthy of note.

Plot Hooks for Orion:
1) He's loyal to those he considers his friends
2) He's compulsive in doing what he believes is right.
3) An overt threat to his people will cause him to return home to deal with the threat

It'll be a while for Rachael.
