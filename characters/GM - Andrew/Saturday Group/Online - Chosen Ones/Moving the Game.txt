Hi Folks,

Apparently the tower site is having issues... due to this, and the fact rpol.net has some nice features I'd like to use (Especially for this interogation scene with Ghost :) ) I've decided to move the game over to rpol.net

The link to the GAME is below - just submit a quickie request to join - Name of the Character if you aren't using your normal Callsign.

NAME OF CAMPAIGN: Chosen Ones of Destiny

Your GM,

Andrew
