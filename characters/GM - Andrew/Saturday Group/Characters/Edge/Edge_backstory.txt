-Human
-Grew up in a small village with his older brother Kirian
-Age 18 - Kirian is 20
-Started doing small jobs around his village to help the family income
-Having worked with blacksmiths, they have trained with a variety of weapons, if not extensively, but enough to be adequate with their fair share of differing types.

	Just after his 18th birthday, they are outside the village gathering food when they run into a band of mercenaries, who in exchange for letting them go, ask them to assist with a job in the area. Not knowing the nature of the job, but knowing that winter is coming and supplies are needed, the brothers agree to help the mercs. They are led to a house on the outskirts of town that they had always assumed to be abandoned, where they are told to enter the house and KILL anyone inside. Thinking as they did that the house was empty, they agreed quickly. They enter the house, and scour all the rooms, checking for any signs of life. As they expected, there was none to be found.
	As they were finishing the search, in the back room , they come across a trapdoor that had not been closed completely, as if someone had left in a hurry. Entering the staircase, which takes them to a basement room. Kirian inadvertently trips an explosive trap, causing both of the brothers to be blown back and knocked out. When Edge comes around, Kirian is still unconscious. Edge checks his body for signs of life, and finds none. Thinking his brother dead, he races out of the house, not even noticing the absence of the mercanaries. As he runs into his home, he frantically searches for his parents, but they are nowhere to be found.
	Running back out, he rushes to the village elders, and bursts in, yelling at all of them at once if anyone knew where his parents might be. The elders know nothing about his parents' whereabouts, and try to ask what has Edge in such a frantic state. Edge attempts to calm down enough to explain the recent events, but as Edge is telling the story, Kirian walks in behind him, seriously burned, but definitely alive. As the room goes silent, Kirian turns to Edge and simply says: "This is all your fault." He says that Edge set up the whole situation, right down to the mercanaries and the explosion, and leading up to his parents disappearance. He claims Edge murdered their parents!!
	The elders take Kirian to the healers and then start to talk to Edge about the events of the day. They seem to think that there may be a middle ground to both of they boys' stories, thinking that maybe Edge set up a prank for his brother that went too far. As to the parents, no one seems to know where they are are what they are doing. After Kirian is patched up, the elders begin to ask him about what happened after the explosion. He explained it exactly how he thought it had happened saying that Edge set up the trap, had gone home and ultimately murdered their parents, Kirian said he had proof of their death. Edge was now sitting outside of the medical area where Kirian and the elders had exited and then headed to the brothers' home. Edge stayed outside of the house while Kirian and the elders entered and went straight to Edge's room where Kirian moved a wolf skin rug that was covering a trap door. Kirian opened the trap door and they all entered where they found the parents bodies, which were covered in slashes. This led the elders to completely believed Kirian. Kirian and the elders went to confront Edge who was still sitting down outside. One of the elders told Edge to not resist them they arrested him and took him to the jailhouse to await trial.
	Edge was distraught at the news of his parents death, and terrified at the thought of thealmost certain execution, but as the night wore on, he knew he had to get out, and find a way to prove his innocence. As he started to collect himself, he remembered helping the blacksmith construct and install the new jail cell doors - the very doors that contained him now. Getting excited, he examined the lock, and recognized the handiwork immediately. He could get out!! Looking around for something to use as a pick, he notices the tree branch...just outside his window. He looks to see if the guard is watching, and finds him asleep. He goes back to the tree branch, snaps off two sturdy twigs, and proceeds to pick the lock on the cell door.
	After finally opening the lock, he sneaks out of the prison and heads back home to grab his traveling gear and some supplies. As he walks into his room, he notices that there is a trapdoor in his floor...which he knew had never been there. He slowly opens the door, and starts down the stairs. When he reaches the room at the bottom, he sees two bodies on the floor and drops to his knees in shock, immediately recognizing the faces of his parents.
	After the initial shock passes, he turns and runs up the stairs, grabs everything he had gathered, and runs out of the house, and just keeps running. As he was running, he collided with something and fell to the ground, dazed. When he clears his head, he looks up, and recognizes the face of one of the mercenaries who had set them up.
