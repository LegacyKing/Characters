Calamar Delsor;   
  
A Prince from Kingdom Centurion.   
  
This young prince is running from home to escape a prearranged marriage to princess [Firona?]. He wants to have some adventure and see the world before settling into the duties of a ruler. However, running from home has opened him up to enemies that would have otherwise needed to get through the kingdom's defenses.  
  
Enemies of the kingdom are numerous and some even powerful. Some want the prince as a handsome ransom; others would like to take control of his mind and make him a puppet when the current ruler dies. Others still want him to marry another to ruin the precarious alliance between Kingdoms Centurion and Carinae and set up another alliance. (Imagine the plot devices there).   
   
The Prince has taken a fake name to hide his identity - 'Calamar Delsor' his true secret name is Caldinsor Dragopersius [Drae Go Pur  C us].  
  
The prince has found that the higher powers have granted him powers - Witchcraft. He's given himself more to them. What their goals are, Calamar isn't concerned with. He's hired on to a fairly reputable Merc Guild to gain experience, plus, the mercs don't ask many questions. A prime spot to hide from the authorities and still do good work. Plus it'll help him understand the underside of society.
