Danalaus
 (Dan-a-lay-us) was born a prince of a small kingdom who was always 
considered attractive as a child. But as he grew into manhood, he became
 so hansom, that people all around began to proclaim Him a god. And 
while he never became arrogant or narcissistic about his looks, this 
still gained him the ire of the true gods, who in spite, jealousy 
and anger cursed him by transforming him into a Minotaur. The horror of 
this turned the entire population of his kingdom and even his family 
away from him, and drove him from the kingdom. 

He spent the next
 several years living in the wilderness avoiding people and trying to 
come to terms with
 what had 
Sean Lujan: befallen him. Because of the ordure (odor?) of bull and man combined in a 
foul occult manor, animals also shy from him, and monsters tend to 
attack as soon as he comes into sight or smell of him. primarily he 
hunts with a bow to keep his distance and has become quite proficient 
with it. After some time, he became so depressed with his condition that
 he considered suicide but something staid his hand, and he, while not 
coming to terms with what he had become, came to the understanding with 
himself that he could no longer continue his life as he was, so began to
 look for a way to regain his humanity.

 He has been seeking for years at temples and asking mystics and wizards 
for a way to earn the gods forgiveness or to break the cures on his own, 
but to no avail...until now. The
Mother Oracle of Delphi has suggested that there maybe a way, but first he must help with a little problem she is having.
