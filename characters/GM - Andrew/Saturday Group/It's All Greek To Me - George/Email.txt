Just before the time when the oceans drank Atlantis, the raise of Jason or the Trajan wars, there was an age undreamed of...


All across the land, sages looked upon the stars with fear and wonder. There was trouble in the heavens. Kings, queens and great warriors where about to be made, others would be destroyed...


The Mother Oracle looked down at her disciples with a grimace. For the first time in the history of Delphi, a student had gone missing. The Mother Oracle thought about the situation for a moment. “Do

not worry my children. She will not get far...”


A proud man looked on his new ship with excitement. It had taken five years and a ton of sliver to build, but it was one of the fastest, finely made ships to sail the sea. Hopefully, Poseidon will be merciful....



Hail all,


I hope to run an exciting and fun game. You will all start off as sailors aboard a merchant ship. I would like a small backstory(about a paragraph or more).


Sincerely,

George

Subject: George's Game - Greek Sailors Ho!

Hi,

Here is the info for George's Campaign. He'll send out the back ground information and add any additional notes. Please have a Paragraph Back Story, and a Concept that will fit the Time Period. George has already nix'd the Samurai, Ronin and Katanas... He'll allow Egyptians. ;) Magic is allowed, just think of Greece Mythos. What he has explained we'll be Sailors hopping from Island... Like Homer and the Iliad.
