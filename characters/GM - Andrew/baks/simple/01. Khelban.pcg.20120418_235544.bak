ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Duties (+2)|APPLIEDTO:Merrick|TYPE:Character Creation.CharCreation.General|DESC:(+2) A character with Duties has extensive obligations. These restrict his or her time and freedom of action, as well as draining his or her resources, but also mean getting a lot of practice or extra training. This typically includes Druids, Clerics, and Paladins. Ignoring your duties brings on various penalties. Strangely, this continues until the GM feels you have enough penalties to equal the points you got from Duties.

ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Mana|APPLIEDTO:|TYPE:General.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:Every level of this ability taken grants an extra 1d6 points of personal Mana, 2d4 generic spell levels, or 3d6 Power. Characters without other psychic abilities do not become vulnerable to psychic attack modes if the game's current rules make psychics more vulnerable to each other. Mana can help with spellcasting, while Power often fuels meditative or martial arts abilities aside from psychic powers. Unfortunately, while Mana is extremely flexible, it recovers at a mere one point per day, two with rest and meditation. Power and generic spell levels recover each day, as usual. As a general rule, 1 point of Mana equates to 2 spell levels or 4 Psionic Power - or one charge from a magic item. Mana is commonly used to power exotic abilities. Abilities which would normally be uses-per day may be designated as using personal Mana instead at 1 use for 2 Mana. If Mana is required as an extra limitation, such powers usually count as Corrupted. Any character with Mana may select one of the forms of Natural Magic described below at no cost. Adding additional forms costs +6 CP each.

Select four related (i.e., get your GM's permission) skills, which you learn for half price. Each rank of a relevant skill now costs only 1/2 CP. Each rank of an irrelevant one now costs only 1 CP. ! You may take this ability twice, affecting two groups of skills, if your Game Master gives you permission. Adept is actually one of the most powerful abilities in the system. It provides a huge skill bonus in exchange for simply deciding on what you're good at. The Game Master should keep a careful eye this. It's most common in Prestige Class conversion.

ABILITY:Disadvantages|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Disadvantage ~ History|TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter|DESC:The player has a few pages of notes for the GM about the character's history, personality, and goals. This should include some mention of friends and family, old enemies or allies, and where the character got his or her training or equipment. The GM should to allow the player several sessions to come up with it all.

You might be noted as an oathbreaker, an "untouchable," a kinslayer, or an ex-slave, belong to a despised ethnic group, believe in a heretical faith, or simply have numerous obnoxious habits. In any case, a sizable segment of the people in the campaign setting will have nothing to do with you.

USERPOOL:Mana Choice|POOLPOINTS:0.0
ABILITY:Natural Magic Choice|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Mana ~ Unskilled Magic|TYPE:NaturalMagicChoice.eclipseabilityoutput|DESC:You may simply announce the spell effect you're trying to produce and dump Mana into it. Whatever-it-is you're trying to do will cost 2 Mana per level of the effect - half of which is wasted and a quarter of which goes into random side effects. The Casting Level equals the user's level or (Int/3 + the effect level), whichever is less. The maximum level of effect which can be produced equals the user's base Will save bonus or (Wis/3), whichever is less. Keeping the side effects down to displays and inconvenient effects (rather than dangerous ones) requires a Cha check at a DC of (&lbracket;2x the Mana used&rbracket; + 6). The side effects are always up to the Game Master. Effects with an extended duration usually require that the caster invest Mana in them; some or all of the Mana used to cast them cannot be recovered while they persist. This does make it easier to cast long-term spells. Unlike most spellcasting, unskilled magic works better under stress. Characters who are furiously angry, utterly outraged, or otherwise on an emotional peak, gain one free point of Mana, which may be spent in excess of the above limits or be used to reduce the cost. Characters who have just seen their lover or child die, are facing certain death, or who are otherwise in the throes of some great passion, get two. Characters who are dying, or who are willing to die in the casting, get four. Even a relatively unskilled dabbler may be able to manage a decent dying curse.
