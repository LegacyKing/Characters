ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Track ~ Eclipse|APPLIEDTO:Wilderness|TYPE:General.eclipseabilityoutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(3 CP). Characters with this feat select Urban, Wilderness, or Dimensional tracking. Tracking requires a Survival (for wilderness) or Gather Information (for urban) check every mile to follow the target. This is DC 15 for favorable conditions, DC 20 for unfavorable ones. Size bonuses on Hide checks apply, and unfavorable lighting may inflict penalties. Dimensional tracking relies on Spellcraft and can trace Gates or teleportation and dimensional travel.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Fast Learner ~ 1 Skills Level Minus Two|TYPE:Character Creation.CharCreation.General.FastLearner|DESC:(+2) This ability grants 1 Skills per eclipse character level.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Armor ~ Light|TYPE:Proficiencies.SpecialQuality|DESC:Proficient with Light Armors
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Bonus Uses ~ Four|APPLIEDTO:Shapeshift|TYPE:Character Creation.Extra.eclipseabilityoutput
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Duties (+2)|APPLIEDTO:Fey Pact|TYPE:Character Creation.CharCreation.General|DESC:(+2) A character with Duties has extensive obligations. These restrict his or her time and freedom of action, as well as draining his or her resources, but also mean getting a lot of practice or extra training. This typically includes Druids, Clerics, and Paladins. Ignoring your duties brings on various penalties. Strangely, this continues until the GM feels you have enough penalties to equal the points you got from Duties.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Lunge|APPLIEDTO:|TYPE:eclipseabilityoutput.CombatEnhancements.Corruptable|DESC:(6 CP). Add +5 feet to your effective reach. Creatures with tentacles, stretching powers, or very long limbs may take this more than once.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Mindspeech|TYPE:General.eclipseabilityoutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(6 CP). You gain the ability to send and receive thoughts with willing (or at least not unwilling) targets within a 60' radius
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Shapeshift ~ Growth|TYPE:General.eclipseabilityoutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(+3 CP) allows Large or Huge forms.&pipe;PREVAREQ&colon;ShapeshiftGrowth,0|DESC:(+9 CP) allows Large, Huge and Gargantuan forms.&pipe;PREVAREQ&colon;ShapeshiftGrowth,1|DESC:(+21 CP) allows Large, Huge, Gargantuan and Colossal forms.&pipe;PREVAREQ&colon;ShapeshiftGrowth,2|DESC:(+24 CP) allows Large, Huge, Gargantuan ,Colossal and Mountainous forms.&pipe;PREVAREQ&colon;ShapeshiftGrowth,3
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Mindspeech ~ Beastspeech|TYPE:General.eclipseabilityoutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(+6 CP) allows full communication with animals, rather than the simple communication of vague emotions and urges possible with basic Mindspeech. While animals generally aren't very smart, this translates things into rough "speech."
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Shapeshift|TYPE:General.eclipseabilityoutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(6 CP) You may take Small or Medium animal forms once per day per 3 character levels as a Standard Action. You may not take a form with more hit dice than you possess. All equipment you carry melds with your new form and is unusable. The new form lasts until you decide to change back. As a side effect, shapeshifters can revert to normal form when polymorphed.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Adept ~ Eclipse|APPLIEDTO:Stealth|TYPE:General.eclipseabilityoutput.Abilities.Corruptable.Adept|DESC:(6 CP). Select four related (i.e., get your GM's permission) skills, which you learn for half price. Each rank of a relevant skill now costs only 1/2 CP. Each rank of an irrelevant one now costs only 1 CP. ! You may take this ability twice, affecting two groups of skills, if your Game Master gives you permission. Adept is actually one of the most powerful abilities in the system. It provides a huge skill bonus in exchange for simply deciding on what you're good at. The Game Master should keep a careful eye this. It's most common in Prestige Class conversion.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Domain Path|APPLIEDTO:|TYPE:General.eclipseabilityoutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(6 CP). You gain access to either a set of thematically linked spells or to a versatile "metaspell" which can be cast at various levels to produce effects within its theme. The domain, path, or metaspell selected or created is subject to the approval of the Game Master. Domains and paths usually include nine spells; one of each of the usual spell levels. They do not include any special domain powers&colon; these must be purchased separately. You may take this ability multiple times. Each time, it adds another domain or path.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Save ~ Will|APPLIEDTO:,,|TYPE:SavingThrow.Character Creation|DESC:Increases the Will Save by +1
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Weapon Prof ~ All Simple Weapons plus any one Martial Weapon|APPLIEDTO:Longbow|TYPE:Proficiencies.SpecialQuality|DESC:Grants Proficiency with all simple weapons and selected weapons.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Unique Training I|TYPE:Character Creation.Extra.eclipseabilityoutput|DESC:Grants 6 CP for Unique Training

ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Track ~ Identification|TYPE:General.eclipseabilityoutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(+3 CP) allows the character to make a relevant knowledge check to determine the species (and any other tracking-related information, such as a limp and its size) of creature he or she is tracking.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Reflex Training|APPLIEDTO:Specialized / Shapeshift is a Free Action|TYPE:General.eclipseabilityoutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(6 CP). With Reflex Training, a character gains a free, immediate, Standard Action under some particular circumstance. You cannot string together more reflexive actions than your relevant attribute bonus (usually Str Mod or Dex Mod). Alternatively, the character may instead simply take an extra Standard Action at any time 3 times per day. You may not use this version more than once per round.

ABILITY:Disadvantages|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Disadvantage ~ History|TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter|DESC:The player has a few pages of notes for the GM about the character's history, personality, and goals. This should include some mention of friends and family, old enemies or allies, and where the character got his or her training or equipment. The GM should to allow the player several sessions to come up with it all.
ABILITY:Disadvantages|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Disadvantage ~ Uncivilized|TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter|DESC:You do not fit into anything beyond a small tribe. Complex social situations, the sheet scale of cities and towns, and business and banking schemes (among other things) are all beyond your grasp. You stick out like a sore thumb in civilized areas and greatly prefer to stick with items, foods, and customs typical of your tribe. You start off with little or no access to advanced equipment or techniques for the setting, and often take a -4 penalty when dealing with civilized societies or technologies.
ABILITY:Disadvantages|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Disadvantage ~ Vows|APPLIEDTO:He has vowed to protect nature where ever possible.|TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter|DESC:While closely related to Compulsive, Vows are generally more restrictive. They're also far more dangerous; those who fail to live up to their vows face some form of retribution. On the other hand, they also get some support; characters gain a +/- 3 bonus (as needed) against attempts to make them break their vows.
