ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Finesse ~ Dex replaces Str for Hit|TYPE:General.eclipseabilityoutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(6 CP). A character with Finesse may replace one attribute modifier with another in some fairly common situation, such as for a particular saving throw.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Warcraft ~ Weapon Focus|APPLIEDTO:Sword (Short)|TYPE:Combat.Base Attack Bonus.SpecialAttack|DESC:Increase selected weapon to hit by +1
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Mystic Artist|TYPE:General.eclipseabilityoutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:Mystic Artists inspire and manipulate others through art. While music, dance, and oratory are the most common forms, storytelling, painting, or architecture also work. See page 84.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Duties (+2)|APPLIEDTO:Honor Your Peoples' Ways|TYPE:Character Creation.CharCreation.General|DESC:(+2) A character with Duties has extensive obligations. These restrict his or her time and freedom of action, as well as draining his or her resources, but also mean getting a lot of practice or extra training. This typically includes Druids, Clerics, and Paladins. Ignoring your duties brings on various penalties. Strangely, this continues until the GM feels you have enough penalties to equal the points you got from Duties.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Save ~ Reflex|APPLIEDTO:|TYPE:SavingThrow.Character Creation|DESC:Increases the Reflex Save by +1
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Save ~ Fortitude|APPLIEDTO:|TYPE:SavingThrow.Character Creation|DESC:Increases the Fortitude Save by +1
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Adept ~ Eclipse|APPLIEDTO:Acrobatics,Gather Information,Martial Arts,Perform (Sing)|TYPE:General.eclipseabilityoutput.Abilities.Corruptable.Adept|DESC:(6 CP). Select four related (i.e., get your GM's permission) skills, which you learn for half price. Each rank of a relevant skill now costs only 1/2 CP. Each rank of an irrelevant one now costs only 1 CP. ! You may take this ability twice, affecting two groups of skills, if your Game Master gives you permission. Adept is actually one of the most powerful abilities in the system. It provides a huge skill bonus in exchange for simply deciding on what you're good at. The Game Master should keep a careful eye this. It's most common in Prestige Class conversion.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Inherent Spell|APPLIEDTO:|TYPE:General.eclipseabilityoutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(6 CP). A character with this ability possesses a natural spell or psychic power of up to level 3. It's usable once per day if it's level 3, twice per day if it's level 2, and includes two different spells usable twice per day each if they're level 1. These spell-like abilities are cast as if by a Sorcerer or Psion of the character's level. Inherent spells generally have a minimum level requirement of (&lbracket;Spell Level x 2&rbracket; -1), but the Game Master may opt to allow exceptions for very low-level characters and/or non-combative inherent spells. A first level character with Scrying is much less of a problem than one with Fireball in most games.|DESC:You may take this ability multiple times. Upgrades do not carry over; each base ability begins its own sequence of related abilities.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Fast Learner ~ 2 Skills ~ Human|APPLIEDTO:Child|TYPE:Character Creation.CharCreation.General|DESC:(+2) This ability grants 2 Skills per eclipse character level.

The character must pay twice the normal experience point cost to create said item.

ABILITY:Disadvantages|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Disadvantage ~ History|TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter|DESC:The player has a few pages of notes for the GM about the character's history, personality, and goals. This should include some mention of friends and family, old enemies or allies, and where the character got his or her training or equipment. The GM should to allow the player several sessions to come up with it all.
ABILITY:Disadvantages|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Disadvantage ~ Uncivilized|TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter|DESC:You do not fit into anything beyond a small tribe. Complex social situations, the sheet scale of cities and towns, and business and banking schemes (among other things) are all beyond your grasp. You stick out like a sore thumb in civilized areas and greatly prefer to stick with items, foods, and customs typical of your tribe. You start off with little or no access to advanced equipment or techniques for the setting, and often take a -4 penalty when dealing with civilized societies or technologies.
ABILITY:Disadvantages|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Disadvantage ~ Compulsive|APPLIEDTO:Loves to tell stories|TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter|DESC:You have some particular mania or "code of conduct" which influences everything you do. Likely compulsions include the classic manias (like Pyro- or Klepto-), an overwhelming love or hatred, greed, dedication to some peculiar goal, truthfulness, extravagent spending, or even virtue. Codes include things like Hippocratic Oaths or Chivalry. Characters that ignore their compulsions take a 20%% experience penalty.

ABILITY:Mystic Artist Skill|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Manipulation ~ Fascinate|TYPE:MysticArtistOutput.MysticArtistSkill.Manipulation|DESC:People like your art. It's fascinating and mysterious and you can even interest the audience in whatever kind of art you do. Some of them might even take it up themselves. More usefully to adventurers, a Mystic Artist can Fascinate up to %1 (Cha Mod + Level/3) targets. If they fail to save, they remain fascinated for up to %2 (Att Mod + 2) minutes, or until a performance ends, whichever comes first. Mystic Artists with a perform skill of 6 or more may attempt to use a Suggestion effect on any one Fascinated target once per round. Those with a skill of 24+ may attempt to Suggest something to all Fascinated targets at the same time.&pipe;FascinateTargets&pipe;AttributeMod+2
ABILITY:Mystic Artist Skill|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Inspiration ~ Emotion|TYPE:MysticArtistOutput.MysticArtistSkill.Inspiration|DESC:You can make everyone in the area feel any strong emotion you care to evoke for up to five rounds after you cease to perform or after they leave the area of your art. In combat you may target either allies or enemies, providing/inflicting a morale bonus/penalty of up to +%1/-%1 on saves against mind-affecting powers and on attacks and damage. Out of combat this is most useful for manipulating crowds or setting the mood for negotiations, oratory, and diplomacy.&pipe;1+floor((MysticArtistSkillTotal/6)+(0.500001))
ABILITY:Mystic Artist Skill|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Manipulation ~ Hold Audience|TYPE:MysticArtistOutput.MysticArtistSkill.Manipulation|DESC:Hold Audience allows you to keep the audience busy, and wile away their time without them realizing it. Any who fail their saving throw become enchanted by your performance or art, and spend more time than they expected. Aside from its usefulness for tavern owners (whose patrons mysteriously spend more time drinking), it's a great distraction. With sufficient attribute and DC enhancements a mystic artist with this ability could hold an entire army spellbound for hours - or even days.
ABILITY:Mystic Artist Skill|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Inspiration ~ Competence|TYPE:MysticArtistOutput.MysticArtistSkill.Inspiration|DESC:Competence is more like it. Now you can give someone a +2 morale bonus to any skill check, attack roll, saving throw, or AC while you use your art, albeit only one of these at a time. It only affects one character.
