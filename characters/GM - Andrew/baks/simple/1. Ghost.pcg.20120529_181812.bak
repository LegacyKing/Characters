In general, each Block attempt uses up an Attack of Opportunity and provides Great Immunity to the attack (Stops 60 Points of Damage).

ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Duties (+2)|APPLIEDTO:Superiors in the Chosen Ones of the Light|TYPE:Character Creation.CharCreation.General|DESC:(+2) A character with Duties has extensive obligations. These restrict his or her time and freedom of action, as well as draining his or her resources, but also mean getting a lot of practice or extra training. This typically includes Druids, Clerics, and Paladins. Ignoring your duties brings on various penalties. Strangely, this continues until the GM feels you have enough penalties to equal the points you got from Duties.

This particular ability package is being purchases as Witchcraft, with all abilities Corrupted / will not work in areas of bright illumination and can be dispelled by light-based powers. &nl; That's a bit of a bottleneck - but this is only a supplementary set of abilities. More importantly, Witchcraft is a very cheap and efficient way to get some fairly good powers - but it doesn't improve much (if at all) with level. Thus it's great for low-level characters, fair for mid-level characters, and only a minor supplement for high-level characters.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Augmented Bonus|APPLIEDTO:Int to Dex based Skills|TYPE:General.eclipseabilityoutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(6 CP).

You may take this ability twice, affecting two groups of skills, if your Game Master gives you permission. Adept is actually one of the most powerful abilities in the system. It provides a huge skill bonus in exchange for simply deciding on what you're good at. The Game Master should keep a careful eye this. It's most common in Prestige Class conversion.

You may be an outlaw, have personal enemies, or have been marked by some mystical entity. The nature of your foes should be decided in consultation with the GM. As a rule, you cannot simply confront your hunters and fight it out with them. They're either numerous, powerful, or secretive.
ABILITY:Disadvantages|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Disadvantage ~ Insane|APPLIEDTO:Compulsively Secretive|TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter|DESC:You're out of your mind. This is usually limited to particular situations or subjects, leaving you sane enough most of the time, but when that trigger comes up you become completely irrational.

This usually means that there's a reward out on you, but it may mean that you will bring a vast price on the slave market, have some mystic quality about you which makes you priceless to a mage, or, for truly exotic character races, that your body parts are extremely valuable.
