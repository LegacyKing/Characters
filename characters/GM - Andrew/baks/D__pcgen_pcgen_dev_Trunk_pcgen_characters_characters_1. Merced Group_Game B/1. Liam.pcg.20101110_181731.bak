#ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Eclipse Restrictions|APPLIEDTO:May not use Armor|TYPE:Character Creation.CharCreation.General|DESC:A character with restrictions has major limitations on the use of some ability or type of equipment. He or she may never (ever!) acquire or use such talents without major penalties. For example, Witch- Hunters never cast spells except to fix the problems caused by other magic on pain of losing most of their abilities. The point bonus is per category which applies. A character only gains the bonus points for restrictions on things that would obviously useful to him or her. Common restrictions include wearing no armor, using no weapons, using no magic or psionics, or skill-related feats. A good explanation is in order. Why is the character restricted in this way?
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Innate Enchantment|APPLIEDTO:|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:With Innate Enchantment, a character has two options - His or her innate power may duplicate the effects of a magical item or items valued at up to 5000 GP (according to the standard d20 rules). The character must pay twice the normal experience point cost to create said item. For every +1 additional CP invested, these innate enchantments rise in value by 1000 GP.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Duties (+2)|APPLIEDTO:To Merrick|TYPE:Character Creation.CharCreation.General|DESC:(+2) A character with Duties has extensive obligations. These restrict his or her time and freedom of action, as well as draining his or her resources, but also mean getting a lot of practice or extra training. This typically includes Druids, Clerics, and Paladins. Ignoring your duties brings on various penalties. Strangely, this continues until the GM feels you have enough penalties to equal the points you got from Duties.

ABILITY:Disadvantages|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Disadvantage ~ Irreverent|APPLIEDTO:No Dieties|TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter|DESC:You are fundamentally unable to accept the "divinity" of gods. You recognize their might and may even see one as a patron, but worphip just isn't part of your nature' they're just really powerful people to you. While gods generally forego directly smiting you, none of them will grant you divine magic and many clerics have a problem with you.
ABILITY:Disadvantages|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Disadvantage ~ Unarmored|TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter|DESC:You refuse to use armor for some reason. Characters who already suffer major penalties for wearing armor can't take this disadvantage.

You may have dependents, debts, a geas, massive tithes, oaths to fulfill, a job which you cannot readily leave, be sworn to the service of a lord or ruler, or just have friends who need looking after. This is a wonderful way to get dragged into adventures.
