You may add a second attribute bonus to the usual one in some specific situation, such as with a skill or set of linked skills, with a specified type of weapon, or against a type of foe.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Duties (+2)|APPLIEDTO:To Higher Ideals|TYPE:Character Creation.CharCreation.General|DESC:(+2) A character with Duties has extensive obligations. These restrict his or her time and freedom of action, as well as draining his or her resources, but also mean getting a lot of practice or extra training. This typically includes Druids, Clerics, and Paladins. Ignoring your duties brings on various penalties. Strangely, this continues until the GM feels you have enough penalties to equal the points you got from Duties.

Note that any uses "left over" after restoring her mana reserve in the morning may be used after napping later in the day. Given a few minutes of rest, one with the knowledge of Chi may regain 4d6 power, 2d6 spell levels (the user allocates where these go), or 1d6 Mana once per day. Characters may use this more often, but incur a cumulative -1 negative level each time (these go away in 24 hours). Characters with Bonus Uses do not suffer this as long as their Bonus Uses hold out.

You may take this multiple times, selecting a different action each time.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Upgrade Human Racial|TYPE:Character Creation|DESC:Upgrades the Fast Learner Human Racial to Double Points
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Mana|APPLIEDTO:,,,,,,,,|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:Every level of this ability taken grants an extra 1d6 points of personal Mana, 2d4 generic spell levels, or 3d6 Power. Characters without other psychic abilities do not become vulnerable to psychic attack modes if the game's current rules make psychics more vulnerable to each other. Mana can help with spellcasting, while Power often fuels meditative or martial arts abilities aside from psychic powers. Unfortunately, while Mana is extremely flexible, it recovers at a mere one point per day, two with rest and meditation. Power andgeneric spell levels recover each day, as usual. As a general rule, 1 point of Mana equates to 2 spell levels or 4 Psionic Power - or one charge from a magic item. Mana is commonly used to power exotic abilities. Abilities which would normally be uses-perday may be designated as using personal Mana instead at 1 use for 2 Mana. If Mana is required as an extra limitation, such powers usually count as Corrupted. Any character with Mana may select one of the forms of Natural Magic described below at no cost. Adding additional forms costs +6 CP each.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Innate Enchantment|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:adds innate power that may duplicate the effects of a magical item or items valued at up to 5000 GP &lbracket;Currently at %1 GP&rbracket; (according to the standard d20 rules). The character must pay twice the normal experience point cost to create said item. For every +1 additional CP invested, these innate enchantments rise in value by 1000 GP.&pipe;InnateEnchantmentAdditional+5000

Select four related (i.e., get your GM's permission) skills, which you learn for half price. Each rank of a relevant skill now costs only 1/2 CP. Each rank of an irrelevant one now costs only 1 CP. ! You may take this ability twice, affecting two groups of skills, if your Game Master gives you permission. Adept is actually one of the most powerful abilities in the system. It provides a huge skill bonus in exchange for simply deciding on what you're good at. The Game Master should keep a careful eye this. It's most common in Prestige Class conversion.

ABILITY:Disadvantages|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Disadvantage ~ Compulsive|APPLIEDTO:Tends to those in need|TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter|DESC:You have some particular mania or "code of conduct" which influences everything you do. Likely compulsions include the classic manias (like Pyro- or Klepto-), an overwhelming love or hatred, greed, dedication to some peculiar goal, truthfulness, extravagent spending, or even virtue. Codes include things like Hippocratic Oaths or Chivalry. Characters that ignore their compulsions take a 20%% experience penalty.
ABILITY:Disadvantages|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Disadvantage ~ Insane|APPLIEDTO:Very Naive about the world|TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter|DESC:You're out of your mind. This is usually limited to particular situations or subjects, leaving you sane enough most of the time, but when that trigger comes up you become completely irrational. This most commonly shows up as phobias (darkness or a class of creature are favorites), but there are innumerable ways to go a little off your rocker.
