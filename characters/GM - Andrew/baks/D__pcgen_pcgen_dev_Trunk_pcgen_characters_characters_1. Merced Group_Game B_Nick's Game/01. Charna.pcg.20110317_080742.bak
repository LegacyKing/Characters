USERPOOL:Character Class Skill Choice|POOLPOINTS:0.0
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Occult Sense|APPLIEDTO:Deathsight|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(6 CP). Occult Sense grants the character a new sense, such as lowlight vision, deathsight (allowing you to sense when someone is near death), the ability to accurately date objects by touch, the ability to sense radiation or magnetic fields, the ability to see ethereal spirits, automatically sensing the current astrological modifiers (if such things are used), and so on. Occult Sense generally counteracts minor penalties or allows minor added abilities. More powerful senses, such as Darkvision (where the character sees even in total darkness) cost the same, but come with limitations. This usually amounts to either being usable 3/day with a duration in rounds equal to the character's level or greatly limited range, usually 60'. Extremely powerful senses are usually only usable in special circumstances.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Buy Skill Point ~ 4|APPLIEDTO:,|TYPE:General.Character Creation.Conversion Stuff
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Save ~ Reflex|APPLIEDTO:,|TYPE:SavingThrow.Character Creation|DESC:Increases the Reflex Save by +1
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Weapon Prof ~ All Simple Weapons plus any one Martial Weapon|APPLIEDTO:Spiked Armor|TYPE:Proficiencies.SpecialQuality|DESC:Grants Proficiency with all simple weapons and selected weapons.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Evasive ~ Uncommon Actions|APPLIEDTO:Grapple|TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.CombatEnhancements.Corruptable|DESC:Evasive characters may take an action (select one) that usually provokes an Attack of Opportunity without being so exposed. You may take this multiple times, selecting a different action each time.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Armor ~ Light|TYPE:Proficiencies.SpecialQuality|DESC:Proficient with Light Armors
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Duties (+2)|APPLIEDTO:To Mr. Claude|TYPE:Character Creation.CharCreation.General|DESC:(+2) A character with Duties has extensive obligations. These restrict his or her time and freedom of action, as well as draining his or her resources, but also mean getting a lot of practice or extra training. This typically includes Druids, Clerics, and Paladins. Ignoring your duties brings on various penalties. Strangely, this continues until the GM feels you have enough penalties to equal the points you got from Duties.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Celerity|APPLIEDTO:Walk|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(6 CP). Celerity adds +10 feet per round to one of your movement modes. This is considered bonus movement for the purposes of skills; it does not apply when calculating movement penalties on skill use.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Martial Arts|APPLIEDTO:,,|TYPE:SpecialAttack.CombatEnhancements.Corruptable|DESC:Unarmed Damage %1d%2&pipe;MartialArtsDie&pipe;MartialArtsDieSize|DESC:(3 CP). A character is considered armed when using unarmed combat so long as he or she places at least 3 CP in this ability. He or she gains a base damage of 1d4 with unarmed attacks. Each +3 CP invested after that increases the damage by one die type (d6/d8/d10/d12), up to a maximum of 1d12 at 15 CP.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Warcraft ~ Normal Progression|APPLIEDTO:,|TYPE:Combat.Base Attack Bonus.SpecialAttack
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Trick|APPLIEDTO:|TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.CombatEnhancements.Corruptable|DESC:(6 CP). You may make a special attack under Specialized circumstances or 3/day, which forces a save and causes a dangerous special effect. The usual DC stands at 10 +(1/2 your level) +(any one relevant attribute modifier). This usually uses Intelligence or Dexterity, but anything's possible.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Mana|APPLIEDTO:|TYPE:General.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:Every level of this ability taken grants an extra 1d6 points of personal Mana, 2d4 generic spell levels, or 3d6 Power. Characters without other psychic abilities do not become vulnerable to psychic attack modes if the game's current rules make psychics more vulnerable to each other. Mana can help with spellcasting, while Power often fuels meditative or martial arts abilities aside from psychic powers. Unfortunately, while Mana is extremely flexible, it recovers at a mere one point per day, two with rest and meditation. Power and generic spell levels recover each day, as usual. As a general rule, 1 point of Mana equates to 2 spell levels or 4 Psionic Power - or one charge from a magic item. Mana is commonly used to power exotic abilities. Abilities which would normally be uses-per day may be designated as using personal Mana instead at 1 use for 2 Mana. If Mana is required as an extra limitation, such powers usually count as Corrupted. Any character with Mana may select one of the forms of Natural Magic described below at no cost. Adding additional forms costs +6 CP each.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Innate Enchantment|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:adds innate power that may duplicate the effects of a magical item or items valued at up to 5000 GP &lbracket;Currently at %1 GP&rbracket; (according to the standard d20 rules). The character must pay twice the normal experience point cost to create said item. For every +1 additional CP invested, these innate enchantments rise in value by 1000 GP.&pipe;InnateEnchantmentAdditional+5000
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Specialist ~ Eclipse|APPLIEDTO:Grapple|TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.CombatEnhancements.Corruptable|DESC:(3 CP). Specialist grants a +4 bonus on any one of the following checks&colon; Grapple, Trip, Sunder, Disarm, Strength-based Overrun checks, or another specialty attack the GM allows.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Reflex Training ~ 3 day|APPLIEDTO:Free Extra Action / Corrupted  Doesn’t work in medium/heavy armor|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(6 CP). With Reflex Training, a character gains a free, immediate, Standard Action under some particular circumstance. You cannot string together more reflexive actions than your relevant attribute bonus (usually Str Mod or Dex Mod). Alternatively, the character may instead simply take an extra Standard Action at any time 3 times per day. You may not use this version more than once per round.

ABILITY:Disadvantages|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Disadvantage ~ Healing Resistant|TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter|DESC:You get only half the benefit of Cure Wounds or Heal spells. Additionally, Neutralize and Remove spells grant you a save to throw off whichever effect they are targeting, but aren't automatic. This does have an upside; the relevant Inflict Wounds, Harm, Contagion, Poison, and Blindness/Deafness spells are similarly reduced in effectiveness, allowing an extra save or halving the effect.
ABILITY:Disadvantages|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Disadvantage ~ Accursed|APPLIEDTO: left eye is a lich eye - a blackened socket with a blue flame within.|TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter|DESC:The universe is out to get you. This covers literal curses, such as dooming those you love, terrible fates, bleeding fire instead of blood, or uncontrollable lycanthropy, as well as lesser, persistent annoyances. The latter might include being a preferred target for attacks (you count as two people if random targeting is used), unpleasant disabilities such as epilepsy, allergies and so on. Your curse can be lifted, but it requires a great deal of work or truly major magic.
ABILITY:Disadvantages|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Disadvantage ~ Stigmata|TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter|DESC:You have some injury which either cannot be healed or has healed badly. It is both painful and inconvenient. You must make a DC 24 Fortitude save at the start of each session; if you fail you take a -1 morale penalty on saving throws for the duration of the session.
