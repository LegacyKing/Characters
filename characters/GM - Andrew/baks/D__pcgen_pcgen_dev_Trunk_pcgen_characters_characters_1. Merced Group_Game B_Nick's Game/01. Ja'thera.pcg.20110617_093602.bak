ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Duties (+2)|APPLIEDTO:Ideals|TYPE:Character Creation.CharCreation.General|DESC:(+2) A character with Duties has extensive obligations. These restrict his or her time and freedom of action, as well as draining his or her resources, but also mean getting a lot of practice or extra training. This typically includes Druids, Clerics, and Paladins. Ignoring your duties brings on various penalties. Strangely, this continues until the GM feels you have enough penalties to equal the points you got from Duties.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Finesse ~ Conor|TYPE:Extra.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(6 CP). A character with Finesse may replace one attribute modifier with another in some fairly common situation, such as for a particular saving throw.

You retain your Dexterity bonus when caught flat-footed or attacked by an invisible assailant and save without penalty against surprises.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Innate Enchantment|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:adds innate power that may duplicate the effects of a magical item or items valued at up to 5000 GP &lbracket;Currently at %1 GP&rbracket; (according to the standard d20 rules). The character must pay twice the normal experience point cost to create said item. For every +1 additional CP invested, these innate enchantments rise in value by 1000 GP.&pipe;InnateEnchantmentAdditional+5000
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Adept|APPLIEDTO:Deception,Perform (Dance),Thievery,Insight|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(6 CP). Select four related (i.e., get your GM's permission) skills, which you learn for half price. Each rank of a relevant skill now costs only 1/2 CP. Each rank of an irrelevant one now costs only 1 CP. ! You may take this ability twice, affecting two groups of skills, if your Game Master gives you permission. Adept is actually one of the most powerful abilities in the system. It provides a huge skill bonus in exchange for simply deciding on what you're good at. The Game Master should keep a careful eye this. It's most common in Prestige Class conversion.

ABILITY:Disadvantages|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Disadvantage ~ Valuable|TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter|DESC:You are worth a lot of money. This usually means that there's a reward out on you, but it may mean that you will bring a vast price on the slave market, have some mystic quality about you which makes you priceless to a mage, or, for truly exotic character races, that your body parts are extremely valuable.
ABILITY:Disadvantages|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Disadvantage ~ Secret|APPLIEDTO:GM Secret|TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter|DESC:There is something buried in your past which you must keep hidden. Your dark secret may range from your unpopular ancestry to being a mass murderer, but bad things happen if it is revealed (i.e., you will get two shiny new disadvantages). Characters most commonly get two from&colon; Hunted, Outcast, Poor Reputation, or Valuable, but things like Accursed, Insane, Obligations, or Unluck may fit in some cases.
ABILITY:Disadvantages|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Disadvantage ~ Dependent|APPLIEDTO:Dice|TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter|DESC:There is something you just have to have to function effectively. You could be addicted to a drug, rely on a special talisman, require constant support and encouragement, or simply be so confused that you need someone to tell you what to do. Unless there's a specific effect involved this defaults to a -3 penalty on your rolls.

ABILITY:Mystic Artist Skill|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Manipulation ~ Fascinate|TYPE:MysticArtistOutput.MysticArtistSkill.Manipulation|DESC:People like your art. It's fascinating and mysterious and you can even interest the audience in whatever kind of art you do. Some of them might even take it up themselves. More usefully toadventurers, a Mystic Artist can Fascinate up to (Cha Mod + Level/3) targets. If they fail to save, they remain fascinated for up to (Att Mod + 2) minutes, or until a performance ends, whichever comes first. Mystic Artists with a perform skill of 6 or more may attempt to use a Suggestion effect on any one Fascinated target once per round. Those with a skill of 24+ may attempt to Suggest something to all Fascinated targets at the same time.
ABILITY:Mystic Artist Skill|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Manipulation ~ Suggestion|TYPE:MysticArtistOutput.MysticArtistSkill.Manipulation|DESC:With this ability, you may make a Suggestion (as per the spell) to one target. Unlike the Fascination-based ability, the art used may be as simple as whistling a snatch of birdsong.
ABILITY:Mystic Artist Skill|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Manipulation ~ Hold Audience|TYPE:MysticArtistOutput.MysticArtistSkill.Manipulation|DESC:Hold Audience allows you to keep the audience busy, and wile away their time without them realizing it. Any who fail their saving throw become enchanted by your performance or art, and spend more time than they expected. Aside from its usefulness for tavern owners (whose patrons mysteriously spend more time drinking), it's a great distraction. With sufficient attribute and DC enhancements a mystic artist with this ability could hold an entire army spellbound for hours - or even days.
ABILITY:Mystic Artist Skill|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Inspiration ~ Competence|TYPE:MysticArtistOutput.MysticArtistSkill.Inspiration|DESC:Competence is more like it. Now you can give someone a +2 morale bonus to any skill check, attack roll, saving throw, or AC while you use your art, albeit only one of these at a time. It only affects one character.
ABILITY:Mystic Artist Skill|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Inspiration ~ Emotion|TYPE:MysticArtistOutput.MysticArtistSkill.Inspiration|DESC:You can make everyone in the area feel any strong emotion you care to evoke for up to five rounds after you cease to perform or after they leave the area of your art. In combat you may target either allies or enemies, providing/inflicting a morale bonus/penalty of up to %1 on saves against mind-affecting powers and on attacks and damage. Out of combat this is most useful for manipulating crowds or setting the mood for negotiations, oratory, and diplomacy.&pipe;1+(var(MysticArts/6))
