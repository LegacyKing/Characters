ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Duties (+2)|APPLIEDTO:Superiors in the Chosen Ones of the Light|TYPE:Character Creation.CharCreation.General|DESC:(+2) A character with Duties has extensive obligations. These restrict his or her time and freedom of action, as well as draining his or her resources, but also mean getting a lot of practice or extra training. This typically includes Druids, Clerics, and Paladins. Ignoring your duties brings on various penalties. Strangely, this continues until the GM feels you have enough penalties to equal the points you got from Duties.

ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Shadow Mastery Package|TYPE:Extra.eclipseabilityoutput|DESC:Shadow Mastery Package (22 CP Total) -  can tap into the magics of twilight and darkness, channeling those hidden forces into a modest variety of tricks. This particular ability package is being purchases as Witchcraft, with all abilities Corrupted / will not work in areas of bright illumination and can be dispelled by light-based powers. &nl; That's a bit of a bottleneck - but this is only a supplementary set of abilities. More importantly, Witchcraft is a very cheap and efficient way to get some fairly good powers - but it doesn't improve much (if at all) with level. Thus it's great for low-level characters, fair for mid-level characters, and only a minor supplement for high-level characters.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Augmented Bonus|APPLIEDTO:Int to Dex based Skills|TYPE:General.eclipseabilityoutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(6 CP). You may add a second attribute bonus to the usual one in some specific situation, such as with a skill or set of linked skills, with a specified type of weapon, or against a type of foe.

Select four related (i.e., get your GM's permission) skills, which you learn for half price. Each rank of a relevant skill now costs only 1/2 CP. Each rank of an irrelevant one now costs only 1 CP. ! You may take this ability twice, affecting two groups of skills, if your Game Master gives you permission. Adept is actually one of the most powerful abilities in the system. It provides a huge skill bonus in exchange for simply deciding on what you're good at. The Game Master should keep a careful eye this. It's most common in Prestige Class conversion.

You may be an outlaw, have personal enemies, or have been marked by some mystical entity. The nature of your foes should be decided in consultation with the GM. As a rule, you cannot simply confront your hunters and fight it out with them. They're either numerous, powerful, or secretive.
ABILITY:Disadvantages|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Disadvantage ~ Valuable|TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter|DESC:You are worth a lot of money. This usually means that there's a reward out on you, but it may mean that you will bring a vast price on the slave market, have some mystic quality about you which makes you priceless to a mage, or, for truly exotic character races, that your body parts are extremely valuable.
ABILITY:Disadvantages|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Disadvantage ~ Insane|APPLIEDTO:Compulsively Secretive|TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter|DESC:You're out of your mind. This is usually limited to particular situations or subjects, leaving you sane enough most of the time, but when that trigger comes up you become completely irrational. This most commonly shows up as phobias (darkness or a class of creature are favorites), but there are innumerable ways to go a little off your rocker.

The user may spend the Power each time he or she is affected by such an ability. Ongoing powers, such as Fear auras, are resisted for 10 rounds. The user may make an extra save against mindreading or "truth" effects by spending a like amount, and may present a false aura to detection spells or ignore pain for 3 power. He or she may pay the Power without spending an action when the effect takes hold.
