Select four related (i.e., get your GM's permission) skills, which you learn for half price. Each rank of a relevant skill now costs only 1/2 CP. Each rank of an irrelevant one now costs only 1 CP. ! You may take this ability twice, affecting two groups of skills, if your Game Master gives you permission. Adept is actually one of the most powerful abilities in the system. It provides a huge skill bonus in exchange for simply deciding on what you're good at. The Game Master should keep a careful eye this. It's most common in Prestige Class conversion.

ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Pact ~ Vow ~ Rituals|APPLIEDTO:Must perform an hour long training session every morning|TYPE:Paths.WitchcraftOutput.Pact|DESC:require the character to regularly perform a major ritual. It is an ongoing nuisance which takes up the character's time and energy. Common rituals include three-day celebrations at the passing of each season, invoking the gods before each and every meal, or long morning meditations.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Duties (+2)|APPLIEDTO:Chosen Ones|TYPE:Character Creation.CharCreation.General|DESC:(+2) A character with Duties has extensive obligations. These restrict his or her time and freedom of action, as well as draining his or her resources, but also mean getting a lot of practice or extra training. This typically includes Druids, Clerics, and Paladins. Ignoring your duties brings on various penalties. Strangely, this continues until the GM feels you have enough penalties to equal the points you got from Duties.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Save ~ Reflex|APPLIEDTO:,|TYPE:SavingThrow.Character Creation|DESC:Increases the Reflex Save by +1

Usually, the character must select three Taboos.

You may take this multiple times, selecting a different action each time.

ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Eclipse Restrictions|APPLIEDTO:Cannot wear Armor|TYPE:Character Creation.CharCreation.General|DESC:A character with restrictions has major limitations on the use of some ability or type of equipment. He or she may never (ever!) acquire or use such talents without major penalties. For example, Witch- Hunters never cast spells except to fix the problems caused by other magic on pain of losing most of their abilities. The point bonus is per category which applies. A character only gains the bonus points for restrictions on things that would obviously useful to him or her. Common restrictions include wearing no armor, using no weapons, using no magic or psionics, or skill-related feats. A good explanation is in order. Why is the character restricted in this way?

The character must pay twice the normal experience point cost to create said item. For every +1 additional CP invested, these innate enchantments rise in value by 1000 GP.&pipe;InnateEnchantmentAdditional+InnateEnchantmentPoolCount

A character is considered armed when using unarmed combat so long as he or she places at least 3 CP in this ability. He or she gains a base damage of 1d4 with unarmed attacks. Each +3 CP invested after that increases the damage by one die type (d6/d8/d10/d12), up to a maximum of 1d12 at 15 CP.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Reflex Training|APPLIEDTO:Make attack after activating power|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(6 CP). With Reflex Training, a character gains a free, immediate, Standard Action under some particular circumstance. You cannot string together more reflexive actions than your relevant attribute bonus (usually Str Mod or Dex Mod). Alternatively, the character may instead simply take an extra Standard Action at any time 3 times per day. You may not use this version more than once per round.

You could be addicted to a drug, rely on a special talisman, require constant support and encouragement, or simply be so confused that you need someone to tell you what to do. Unless there's a specific effect involved this defaults to a -3 penalty on your rolls.

You may be an outlaw, have personal enemies, or have been marked by some mystical entity. The nature of your foes should be decided in consultation with the GM. As a rule, you cannot simply confront your hunters and fight it out with them. They're either numerous, powerful, or secretive.
ABILITY:Disadvantages|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Disadvantage ~ Vows|APPLIEDTO:Help the poor and don't expect the favor returned|TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter|DESC:While closely related to Compulsive, Vows are generally more restrictive. They're also far more dangerous; those who fail to live up to their vows face some form of retribution. On the other hand, they also get some support; characters gain a +/- 3 bonus (as needed) against attempts to make them break their vows.

ABILITY:Witchcraft Abilities|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Witchcraft ~ Witchsight|TYPE:WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAbilities|DESC:Sharpening or expanding the user's senses is a simple trick. In general, this affects one sense at a time, providing either a +6 bonus on relevant checks or some special capability (Darksight, Scent, etc). As a rule this costs 1 Power and lasts for about an hour. Witches may triple the effect by reducing the duration to a single round, allowing effects such as checking a meal for poison with the slightest taste.
ABILITY:Witchcraft Abilities|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Witchcraft ~ Hyloka|TYPE:WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAbilities|DESC:The manipulation of biophysical processes is a rare gift. This can be used to briefly move physical attribute points around (up to 6 points for 1 Power per hour), slip into hibernation (1 power; lasts up to a week), help resist heat or cold (1 Power per hour, this grants 5 points of fire or cold resistance), stop bleeding, delay poison (one hour per power), grow hair or make it fall out (1 power), and to inflict or ease ailments like arthritis (spend 1 power/week to inflict, 1 power/day to ease).
ABILITY:Witchcraft Abilities|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Witchcraft ~ The Inner Eye|TYPE:WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAbilities|DESC:Thought-sensing can be used to see surface thoughts, to detect the presence of a hidden being, to share a target's senses, or to read any psychic impressions left behind on an object by strong emotion. This provides a +6 on any relevant Spot, Sense Motive, or Listen checks for 1 Power per 10 minutes.
ABILITY:Witchcraft Abilities|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Witchcraft ~ The Adamant Will|TYPE:WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAbilities|DESC:This talent allows users to spend 2 Power to resist Fear, Possession, Charm, Hold effects, and other forms of mind control. The user may spend the Power each time he or she is affected by such an ability. Ongoing powers, such as Fear auras, are resisted for 10 rounds. The user may make an extra save against mindreading or "truth" effects by spending a like amount, and may present a false aura to detection spells or ignore pain for 3 power. He or she may pay the Power without spending an action when the effect takes hold.
ABILITY:Witchcraft Abilities|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Witchcraft ~ Shadowweave|TYPE:WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAbilities|DESC:Shadowweave manipulates light and darkness to craft minor illusions. Normally 1 Power grants 10 minutes of activity. Effects include will-o-the wisps, cloaking (+6 to stealth and disguise rolls), various apparitions, spheres of darkness, blinding rays of light and hiding small actions - such as slipping out a dagger, picking a pocket, or a strike in combat (offers a +3 circumstance bonus to the user's roll).|DESC:For +6 CP the user may expand his or her repertoire to level 2 (2 power) and 3 (4 power) illusion-casting effects (compare to the Sorcerer/Wizard list).&pipe;PREABILITY&colon;1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Witchcraft ~ Shadowweave ~ Advanced
ABILITY:Witchcraft Abilities|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Witchcraft ~ Infliction|TYPE:WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAbilities|DESC:Often manifested as phantom force-claws, heart attacks, inexplicable bleeding, and agonizing pain, Infliction causes injury through psychic force. This can include spectacular attacks - throwing fiery balls or thunderbolts or such - but is usually subtle. In any case, it deals 1d4 hit points of damage per character level, to a maximum of 3/5/7 d4 damage for 1/2/3 power. Targets may make a save for half damage, but the save used depends on the form of the attack. Infliction normally affects a single target, but may be expanded to a fivefoot radius for +3 power.
ABILITY:Witchcraft Abilities|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Witchcraft ~ The Hand of Shadows|TYPE:WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAbilities|DESC:The Hand of Shadows covers basic telekinesis. Minor tricks (like bending spoons) cost no power. Exerting a force equal to what you could physically handle costs 1 Power per minute. Light but rapid work (like sorting wheat from chaff) costs 1 Power per hour's worth of work done. Minor animations (Entangle, Animate Rope) approximate the relevant spells at a cost of 2 power, +2 if excessive force or fine control is required.
