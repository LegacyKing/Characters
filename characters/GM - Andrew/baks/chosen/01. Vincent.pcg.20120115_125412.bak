ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Companion ~ Might|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(+6 CP) allows you to grant your companion the benefits of two Positive Levels (see page 86).
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Berserker|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(6 CP). The Berserker ability grants extreme but short-lived bonuses. The user normally gains +4 to two attributes, +2 to a saving throw or AC, and -2 to another attribute, save, or AC for (3+Con Mod) rounds 1/day. The user gains another berserk session per day per 3 character levels or part thereof. The user becomes fatigued after using Berserker. GM's should note that the character may not generally do anything else but a specified, focused task or similar stunt. For the classic barbarian rage, the character can do little except immediate, physical skills and tasks, mostly meaning combat. Note that the guidelines on where the bonuses should  go are not meant as absolute rules; let a character picksomething appropriate. AC, damage bonuses, to-hit bonuses, Caster Level, or even turning might all be acceptable choices depending on the character. The bonuses must simply total +8 (the character may apply a -2 penalty somewhere to add an additional +2).
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Duties (+2)|APPLIEDTO:Chosen Ones|TYPE:Character Creation.CharCreation.General|DESC:(+2) A character with Duties has extensive obligations. These restrict his or her time and freedom of action, as well as draining his or her resources, but also mean getting a lot of practice or extra training. This typically includes Druids, Clerics, and Paladins. Ignoring your duties brings on various penalties. Strangely, this continues until the GM feels you have enough penalties to equal the points you got from Duties.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Ability Focus ~ Group of Abilities|APPLIEDTO:Time Magic|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:You add +2 to the DC of resisting to a particular school, technique, descriptor, domain, or path of magic, a small group of innate magical abilities, or another modest group of abilities.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Buy Skill Point|APPLIEDTO:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|TYPE:General.Character Creation.Conversion Stuff
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Weapon Prof ~ All Simple and Martial Weapons|TYPE:Proficiencies.SpecialQuality|DESC:Grants Proficiency with all simple and martial weapons.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Warcraft ~ Normal Progression|APPLIEDTO:,,,|TYPE:Combat.Base Attack Bonus.SpecialAttack
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Deep Sleep|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:Many ascetics study meditation and mysticism. In d20, these skills are as useful as any. With Deep Sleep, a character gains the benefits of a full night's rest in only four hours and may ignore minor (up to 15 minutes total) interruptions in that interval.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Buy Skill Point ~ 2|APPLIEDTO:,|TYPE:General.Character Creation.Conversion Stuff
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Journeyman ~ Skill|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:A Journeyman may purchase some type of ability (often skills or spellcasting) as if he or she were one level higher, increasing the usual (Level + 3) cap.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Innate Enchantment|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:adds innate power that may duplicate the effects of a magical item or items valued at up to 5000 GP &lbracket;Currently at %1 GP&rbracket; (according to the standard d20 rules). The character must pay twice the normal experience point cost to create said item. For every +1 additional CP invested, these innate enchantments rise in value by 1000 GP.&pipe;InnateEnchantmentAdditional+5000
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Berserker ~ Odinpower|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(+3 CP) usually increases the bonuses to +6, +6 and +3 respectively. The total increases to +13.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Save ~ Fortitude|APPLIEDTO:,,,|TYPE:SavingThrow.Character Creation|DESC:Increases the Fortitude Save by +1
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Eldritch|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(0 CP). You may call upon exotic forces to power your magic rather than relying on the usual sources. In other words, your magic may have strange special effects for free. This has no direct game effect, but gives you more style. Eldritch abilities that cost spell levels do not extend the casting time.|DESC:Characters using advanced Eldritch feats must select and describe the source of their powers. Other characters with the Eldritch feat and the same source receive no penalties or advantages when facing the user. All three effects may be taken as a set for only 6 CP, but this cannot then be "turned off." It also limits use of magic items to items made by a character with at least one of these modifiers. Many settings have spells usable only with Eldritch magic, and others not usable at all with Eldritch magic.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Immunity / XP Cost Initial Innate Enchanment|TYPE:Abilities.General.EclipseAbilityOutput|DESC:(2 CP) Handles initial Innate Enchantment, L1 only.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Save ~ Reflex|APPLIEDTO:,,,,,|TYPE:SavingThrow.Character Creation|DESC:Increases the Reflex Save by +1
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Skill Focus ~ Mastery Improved|APPLIEDTO:Rune Casting (Force),Rune Casting (Time),Rune Mastery (Force),Rune Mastery (Time)|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:additional +1 to existing choices
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Companion ~ Template|APPLIEDTO:|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(+6 CP) adds a template of up to +2 ECL to the companion. Only one Template can be applied to a given companion, but you may pay the cost multiple times to add a more powerful template. The ECL addition is cumulative up to a maximum of +6.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Skill Focus|APPLIEDTO:Rune Casting (Force),Rune Casting (Time),Rune Mastery (Force),Rune Mastery (Time)|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:+3 bonus to any single skill. Skill Focus stacks with Skill Emphasis.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Berserker ~ Enduring|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(+3 CP) removes the fatigue after the berserker session. This is often combined with Corrupted Bonus Uses (only to extend the duration).
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Companion ~ Transference|APPLIEDTO:|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(+Sp.) allows you to give CP to your Companion. He, she, or it receives 2 CP for every 1 CP you surrender.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Skill Focus ~ Mastery|APPLIEDTO:Rune Casting (Force),Rune Casting (Time),Rune Mastery (Force),Rune Mastery (Time)|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:+1 to existing choices
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Skill Emphasis|APPLIEDTO:Rune Casting (Force),Rune Casting (Time),Rune Mastery (Force),Rune Mastery (Time)|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:This grants a +2 bonus on any single skill.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Rite of Chi|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(6 CP). Given a few minutes of rest, one with the knowledge of Chi may regain 4d6 power, 2d6 spell levels (the user allocates where these go), or 1d6 Mana once per day. Characters may use this more often, but incur a cumulative -1 negative level each time (these go away in 24 hours). Characters with Bonus Uses do not suffer this as long as their Bonus Uses hold out.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Fast Learner (Specialized)|APPLIEDTO:Skills|TYPE:Character Creation.CharCreation.General|DESC:(+2) Actually purchased as a feat for 6 CP, this ability grants extra CP as the character rises in level. Specialized versions are available and encouraged. No one may take Fast Learner more than once unless it's been built into a template, race, or class by the Game Master.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Mana|APPLIEDTO:,,,,,|TYPE:General.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:Every level of this ability taken grants an extra 1d6 points of personal Mana, 2d4 generic spell levels, or 3d6 Power. Characters without other psychic abilities do not become vulnerable to psychic attack modes if the game's current rules make psychics more vulnerable to each other. Mana can help with spellcasting, while Power often fuels meditative or martial arts abilities aside from psychic powers. Unfortunately, while Mana is extremely flexible, it recovers at a mere one point per day, two with rest and meditation. Power and generic spell levels recover each day, as usual. As a general rule, 1 point of Mana equates to 2 spell levels or 4 Psionic Power - or one charge from a magic item. Mana is commonly used to power exotic abilities. Abilities which would normally be uses-per day may be designated as using personal Mana instead at 1 use for 2 Mana. If Mana is required as an extra limitation, such powers usually count as Corrupted. Any character with Mana may select one of the forms of Natural Magic described below at no cost. Adding additional forms costs +6 CP each.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Fortune ~ Defiant|TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.CombatEnhancements.Corruptable|DESC:The ever-useful Fortune feat gives the character the ability to entirely ignore certain effects on a successful save. If a spell or effect has an entry such as "Fort Partial" or "Ref half," this feat works.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Mystic Link|APPLIEDTO:Courrputed and Specialized // Familiar Only|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:A character with Mystic Link has an occult bond with someone or something. He or she may sense the target or the direction it lies in.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Adept|APPLIEDTO:Rune Casting (Time),Rune Casting (Force),Rune Mastery (Force),Rune Mastery (Time)|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(6 CP). Select four related (i.e., get your GM's permission) skills, which you learn for half price. Each rank of a relevant skill now costs only 1/2 CP. Each rank of an irrelevant one now costs only 1 CP. ! You may take this ability twice, affecting two groups of skills, if your Game Master gives you permission. Adept is actually one of the most powerful abilities in the system. It provides a huge skill bonus in exchange for simply deciding on what you're good at. The Game Master should keep a careful eye this. It's most common in Prestige Class conversion.

You may be an outlaw, have personal enemies, or have been marked by some mystical entity. The nature of your foes should be decided in consultation with the GM. As a rule, you cannot simply confront your hunters and fight it out with them. They're either numerous, powerful, or secretive.
ABILITY:Disadvantages|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Disadvantage ~ Hallucinations Flashbacks and Visions|APPLIEDTO:Odd visions|TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter|DESC:Your version of reality doesn't always agree with that of those about you. While this is common enough with respect to details, in your case it may extend to things like whether it's daytime. More commonly, and most dangerously, you may simply see a distorted version of what everyone else sees. This is up to the GM, but the occasional Will save (DC 18) is suggested, or you may react in a radically different manner than those about you.
ABILITY:Disadvantages|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Disadvantage ~ Compulsive|APPLIEDTO:Enjoys toying with Time|TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter|DESC:You have some particular mania or "code of conduct" which influences everything you do. Likely compulsions include the classic manias (like Pyro- or Klepto-), an overwhelming love or hatred, greed, dedication to some peculiar goal, truthfulness, extravagent spending, or even virtue. Codes include things like Hippocratic Oaths or Chivalry. Characters that ignore their compulsions take a 20%% experience penalty.
