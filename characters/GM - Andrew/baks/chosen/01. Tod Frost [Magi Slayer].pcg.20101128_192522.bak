ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Immunity / XP Cost Innate Enchantment|TYPE:Abilities.General.EclipseAbilityOutput|DESC:(2 CP) Handles initial Innate Enchantment, L1 only.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Ability Focus ~ Specific Ability|APPLIEDTO:Illusion DCs|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:You add +2 to the DC of resisting one of your specific abilities, such as a breath weapon, special ability, particular spell, or specific poison.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Enthusiast ~ Double|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(+3 CP) upgrades Enthusiast so that it grants 2 floating CP instead of 1.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Duties (+2)|APPLIEDTO:Chosen Ones|TYPE:Character Creation.CharCreation.General|DESC:(+2) A character with Duties has extensive obligations. These restrict his or her time and freedom of action, as well as draining his or her resources, but also mean getting a lot of practice or extra training. This typically includes Druids, Clerics, and Paladins. Ignoring your duties brings on various penalties. Strangely, this continues until the GM feels you have enough penalties to equal the points you got from Duties.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Finesse ~ Int for Str ~ To Hit|TYPE:Abilities.EclipseAbilityOutput|DESC:Finesse / INT replaces STR (To Hit)
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Metamagic ~ Compact|TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.Metamagical.Corruptable|DESC:You have learned to reduce the level of spells by adding special requirements and components to their casting.|DESC:(6 CP). In general, no matter how many conditions are added, spells cannot have their base level reduced by more than 3. Another 3 levels' worth of conditions can be used to compensate for other metamagics, however. Unfortunately, what conditions may be applied to any given spell or in any given world must be left to the discretion of the Game Master. The following list should cover most possibilities. ! (-1 SL) Taking 10 times the usual casting time. Assume that this modifier has already been applied to any spell with a casting time of one minute or more. Using the Easy/Temporal metamagic on such a spell requires buying off this bonus first. ! (-1 SL) Using expensive components or foci. Spells that already require such things have this modifier applied already. ! (-1 SL) Calling on a friendly extraplanar patron with powers similar to the spell (and owing them a minor favor). Most major divine magic already includes this modifier. ! (-1 SL) Spending 10-200 XP. Spells which already cost XP already include this modifier. ! (-1 SL) Taking 1d4 points of attribute damage from the casting. ! (-1 SL) Taking 1d6 damage per level of the spell in casting it (use the base level of the spell). ! (-1 SL) Becoming exhausted when you cast it. ! (-1 SL) Drastically reducing the range, duration, and/or area of effect.  ! (-1 SL) Working at an appropriate time or place of power for the type of magic you're invoking.! (-2 SL) Taking days or weeks to cast. This supersedes the -1 SL time modifier. Only -1 SL for spells which normally take a minute or more to cast. ! (-2 SL) Using outrageously elaborate or expensive spell components, such as a large temple. This supersedes expensive components, above. ! (-2 SL) Spending 201-1000 XP. See above. ! (-2 SL) Undertaking a quest for an extraplanar patron with similar powers in exchange for their help (only -1 level for divine spellcasters). ! (-3 SL) Spending 1001-5000 XP. See above. ! (-4 SL) Dying to cast it. (Raise Dead still works.) ! (-5 SL) Being crippled or horribly, and nearly irrevocably, cursed to cast it. ! (-6 SL) Dying irreversibly to cast it.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Buy Skill Point|APPLIEDTO:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|TYPE:General.Character Creation.Conversion Stuff
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Warcraft ~ Normal Progression|APPLIEDTO:,,|TYPE:Combat.Base Attack Bonus.SpecialAttack
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Create Relic ~ Eclipse|APPLIEDTO:Specialized and Corrupted / only for use with Enthusiast Points and can't exceed 2 CP Relic|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable.ItemCreation|DESC:(6 CP). Another classical way to create weird and wonderful devices, Create Relic allows you to invest CP directly into items. Each 1 CP permanently invested in such an item grants it 6 CP worth of abilities to bestow on the user. While this is permanently weakens you, and creates items which are intimately tied to you, it does allow the creation of truly impressive devices without having to expend a lot of CP on special abilities. Such items are very good links to you for certain magical activities.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Metamagic ~ Triggering|TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.Metamagical.Corruptable.Streamline|DESC:You can set up delays or activation conditions and program your spells to choose between options on their own.|DESC:(6 CP).  Triggering options normally persist for 24 hours, except where noted otherwise. ! Holding keeps a touch spell ready while you do something else for up to 10 minutes. This costs no spell levels, although spontaneous casters do have the casting time extended as usual. ! Simple Conditions (+1 SL) or a time delay costs +1 spell level. This includes 'Activate on command,' 'Wait ten minutes,' and 'When the next group of people come by.' ! Complex Conditions (+2 SL) allow the caster to use multiple Simple triggers at once. ! Programmed Conditions (+3 SL) allow the caster to set up contingent effects (or several contingent effects) with a specified target, such as 'Activate when I reach half my hit points.' ! Mobile Focus (+1 SL) allows the spell to locate and select targets on its own initiative. These spells have a +0 ranged attack bonus, should it matter. This includes 'Fire yourself at my enemies chasing after me past the obelisk.' Also, this anchors the spell to a physical item which can be moved or left behind, whereas the previous versions either kept the spell near the caster or at a specific location.! Clockwise (+1 SL) adds to the time limit. Casters may relax the limit by an additional 24 hours with Extension. This doesn't increase the spell's duration, but will allow a trigger to remain active for longer. The caster may stack as many of these as he or she can afford.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Innate Enchantment|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:adds innate power that may duplicate the effects of a magical item or items valued at up to 5000 GP &lbracket;Currently at %1 GP&rbracket; (according to the standard d20 rules). The character must pay twice the normal experience point cost to create said item. For every +1 additional CP invested, these innate enchantments rise in value by 1000 GP.&pipe;InnateEnchantmentAdditional+5000
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Eclipse Restrictions|APPLIEDTO:Cannot wear armor|TYPE:Character Creation.CharCreation.General|DESC:A character with restrictions has major limitations on the use of some ability or type of equipment. He or she may never (ever!) acquire or use such talents without major penalties. For example, Witch- Hunters never cast spells except to fix the problems caused by other magic on pain of losing most of their abilities. The point bonus is per category which applies. A character only gains the bonus points for restrictions on things that would obviously useful to him or her. Common restrictions include wearing no armor, using no weapons, using no magic or psionics, or skill-related feats. A good explanation is in order. Why is the character restricted in this way?
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Save ~ Fortitude|APPLIEDTO:,,,,|TYPE:SavingThrow.Character Creation|DESC:Increases the Fortitude Save by +1
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Pact ~ Service ~ Spirit|APPLIEDTO:The Red Knight|TYPE:Paths.WitchcraftOutput.Pact|DESC:means the entity will claim the character's spirit upon death. The character can't be Raised or Resurrected without potent magic (7th level or higher) or the permission of the being involved. This usually, but not always, implies that said entity is either too minor or too unpleasant to get spiritual assistants in any other way. Exceptions include gods who simply like to personalize things, worlds with otherwise 'generic' afterlives (such as the Greek mythology), and so on.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:The Path of Light ~ Warding|TYPE:Paths.WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAdvancedAbilities|DESC:This deceptively simple ability allows the user to share his or her defenses with others, without reducing them thereby. Protecting those within a 10' radius costs 3 Power, but lasts for at least ten minutes. During this time the user makes a saving throw first, and only if he or she fails do the protected individuals make a check. The user may also opt to share specific savingthrow bonuses, but in this case everybody must save on their own. Bonuses to AC may be shared in the same manner, as may resistances and any other special defense the GM allows. Laying a long-term warding on an individual is possible, but costs 3 Power which can't be recovered until the ward is dropped.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Reflex Training|APPLIEDTO:Cast Touch Spells|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(6 CP). With Reflex Training, a character gains a free, immediate, Standard Action under some particular circumstance. You cannot string together more reflexive actions than your relevant attribute bonus (usually Str Mod or Dex Mod). Alternatively, the character may instead simply take an extra Standard Action at any time 3 times per day. You may not use this version more than once per round.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Pact ~ Energy ~ Madness|APPLIEDTO:Going Mad|TYPE:Paths.WitchcraftOutput.Pact|DESC:stems from truly unnatural magic. A character who spends more than his or her (Wis Score) in Power on Witchery each day goes just a little bit nuts. While it starts off as mere eccentricity, this grows a bit towards true insanity each time the character overspends.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Weapon Prof ~ All Simple Weapons|TYPE:Proficiencies.SpecialQuality|DESC:Grants Proficiency with all simple weapons.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Save ~ Reflex|APPLIEDTO:,,,,|TYPE:SavingThrow.Character Creation|DESC:Increases the Reflex Save by +1

ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Skill Focus|APPLIEDTO:Rune Casting (Bubbles),Rune Casting (Illusion),Rune Mastery (Bubbles),Rune Mastery (Illusion)|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:+3 bonus to any single skill. Skill Focus stacks with Skill Emphasis.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Metamagic ~ Multiple|TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.Metamagical.Corruptable.Streamline|DESC:You have learned how to combine multiple spells into one.|DESC:(6 CP).  Common applications of this technique include&colon; ! Combine. You may stuff a number of spell levels into a single spell slot equal to the (slot level -1) and cast them as one effect. Thus, several low level spells can go off with one casting. The spells do not need the same target, duration, or any other attribute. The sole exception is if the caster uses a spell slot with inherent limitations on it such as those possessed by a Wizard with school specialization. In that case, every spell within the slot must meet every requirement of the slot. ! Spamming repeats a spell multiple times.. The cost is equal to (+2 SL + the number of times the character desires the spell to activate). This cost is reduced by 1 if the spell takes effect once per round instead of all going off at once and by 2 if the user must "recast" each successive repetition on successive rounds. For example, a Fireball that takes effect four times would cost +6 spell levels. If only one goes off per round, it's +5. If you have to keep casting, it's only +4. ! The Chain variant (+3 SL) jumps from target to target, just like the 3.0 Chain Lightning spell. It homes in on the nearest available valid target, then strikes the next. GM's and players should use some caution with this power, as it tends to go out of control. This effect reduces the effective Caster Level by 1 per jump. Some spells, such as Charm Monster, may not be suitable and the GM can ban them or increase the cost. Reduce this option to +2 SL if the spell only jumps once per round. ! Bump (+4 SL), similar to Chain, lets spells hit the primary target, then affect one secondary target per Caster Level at half power. Reduce this option to +3 SL if the spell only takes effect once per round.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Pact ~ Infusion ~ Possession|APPLIEDTO:The Red Knight|TYPE:Paths.WitchcraftOutput.Pact|DESC:takes hold of the character at various intervals. On the bright side, the GM can sometimes take actions for the character when he or she's been rendered unconscious or stunned. On the downside, this causes the character to sometimes take actions he or she doesn't want to. NPC's sometimes go mad from the mental strain, but most PC's are made of tougher stuff.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:The Path of Light ~ Sanctify|TYPE:Paths.WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAdvancedAbilities|DESC:Sanctify allows the Witch to imbue an area with holy light, warding off evil beings and protecting those inside. A quick ward can be used by adventuring Witches or those in a fight to grant a +2 bonus to saving throws, AC, and attack rolls against devils, demons, undead, and any other creature the GM feels fits the definition of "evil entity." This costs 5 Power, covers a 40' radius, and lasts for 1 hour. More lasting wards cost less Power but must be powered each day. These cost 2 Power, but increase the above effect to a +4 bonus. For an additional 1 Power each day, the site so sanctified has a cumulative +2 bonus or 10%% chance each day of negating most curses or induced disorders, such as blindness caused by the Blindness/Deafness spell. These sites purify food and water on the grounds.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Pact ~ Infusion ~ Corruption|APPLIEDTO:The Red Knight|TYPE:Paths.WitchcraftOutput.Pact|DESC:gradually transforms the Witch into a fitting host as he or she goes up in level. Aside from the physical transformation, the GM gets 2 CP out of the character's pool every level to spend on whatever he or she pleases. Fortunately, the GM actually spends 3 CP, meaning the player gets a small bonus overall. Of course, gradually transforming into an alien being makes you stand out a bit.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Skill Emphasis|APPLIEDTO:Rune Casting (Bubbles),Rune Casting (Illusion),Rune Mastery (Bubbles),Rune Mastery (Illusion)|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:This grants a +2 bonus on any single skill.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Mana|APPLIEDTO:,,,,,,,|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:Every level of this ability taken grants an extra 1d6 points of personal Mana, 2d4 generic spell levels, or 3d6 Power. Characters without other psychic abilities do not become vulnerable to psychic attack modes if the game's current rules make psychics more vulnerable to each other. Mana can help with spellcasting, while Power often fuels meditative or martial arts abilities aside from psychic powers. Unfortunately, while Mana is extremely flexible, it recovers at a mere one point per day, two with rest and meditation. Power andgeneric spell levels recover each day, as usual. As a general rule, 1 point of Mana equates to 2 spell levels or 4 Psionic Power - or one charge from a magic item. Mana is commonly used to power exotic abilities. Abilities which would normally be uses-perday may be designated as using personal Mana instead at 1 use for 2 Mana. If Mana is required as an extra limitation, such powers usually count as Corrupted. Any character with Mana may select one of the forms of Natural Magic described below at no cost. Adding additional forms costs +6 CP each.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Fast Learner (Specialized)|APPLIEDTO:Skills|TYPE:Character Creation.CharCreation.General|DESC:(+2) Actually purchased as a feat for 6 CP, this ability grants extra CP as the character rises in level. Specialized versions are available and encouraged. No one may take Fast Learner more than once unless it's been built into a template, race, or class by the Game Master.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Rite of Chi|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(6 CP). Given a few minutes of rest, one with the knowledge of Chi may regain 4d6 power, 2d6 spell levels (the user allocates where these go), or 1d6 Mana once per day. Characters may use this more often, but incur a cumulative -1 negative level each time (these go away in 24 hours). Characters with Bonus Uses do not suffer this as long as their Bonus Uses hold out.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Enthusiast|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(3 CP). Enthusiast grants 1 floating CP. Given 72 hours to retrain and redirect it you may put it into anything you please save for Specific Knowledges (page 10), boosting that ability until you turn your enthusiasm in another direction.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Adept|APPLIEDTO:Rune Casting (Bubbles),Rune Casting (Illusion),Rune Mastery (Bubbles),Rune Mastery (Illusion)|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(6 CP). Select four related (i.e., get your GM's permission) skills, which you learn for half price. Each rank of a relevant skill now costs only 1/2 CP. Each rank of an irrelevant one now costs only 1 CP. ! You may take this ability twice, affecting two groups of skills, if your Game Master gives you permission. Adept is actually one of the most powerful abilities in the system. It provides a huge skill bonus in exchange for simply deciding on what you're good at. The Game Master should keep a careful eye this. It's most common in Prestige Class conversion.

As a rule, you cannot simply confront your hunters and fight it out with them. They're either numerous, powerful, or secretive.
ABILITY:Disadvantages|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Disadvantage ~ Hallucinations Flashbacks and Visions|APPLIEDTO:Military Life|TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter|DESC:Your version of reality doesn't always agree with that of those about you. While this is common enough with respect to details, in your case it may extend to things like whether it's daytime. More commonly, and most dangerously, you may simply see a distorted version of what everyone else sees. This is up to the GM, but the occasional Will save (DC 18) is suggested, or you may react in a radically different manner than those about you.

ABILITY:Witchcraft Abilities|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Witchcraft ~ Witchsight|TYPE:Paths.WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAbilities|DESC:Sharpening or expanding the user's senses is a simple trick. In general, this affects one sense at a time, providing either a +6 bonus on relevant checks or some special capability (Darksight, Scent, etc). As a rule this costs 1 Power and lasts for about an hour. Witches may triple the effect by reducing the duration to a single round, allowing effects such as checking a meal for poison with the slightest taste.
ABILITY:Witchcraft Abilities|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Witchcraft ~ The Adamant Will|TYPE:Paths.WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAbilities|DESC:This talent allows users to spend 2 Power to resist Fear, Possession, Charm, Hold effects, and other forms of mind control. The user may spend the Power each time he or she is affected by such an ability. Ongoing powers, such as Fear auras, are resisted for 10 rounds. The user may make an extra save against mindreading or "truth" effects by spending a like amount, and may present a false aura to detection spells or ignore pain for 3 power. He or she may pay the Power without spending an action when the effect takes hold.
ABILITY:Witchcraft Abilities|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Witchcraft ~ Shadowweave|TYPE:Paths.WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAbilities|DESC:Shadowweave manipulates light and darkness to craft minor illusions. Normally 1 Power grants 10 minutes of activity. Effects include will-o-the wisps, cloaking (+6 to stealth and disguise rolls), various apparitions, spheres of darkness, blinding rays of light and hiding small actions - such as slipping out a dagger, picking a pocket, or a strike in combat (offers a +3 circumstance bonus to the user's roll).|DESC:For +6 CP the user may expand his or her repertoire to level 2 (2 power) and 3 (4 power) illusion-casting effects (compare to the Sorcerer/Wizard list).&pipe;PREABILITY&colon;1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Witchcraft ~ Shadowweave ~ Advanced

ABILITY:Advanced Witchcraft Ability|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:The Path of Fire ~ Leaping Fire|TYPE:Paths.WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAdvancedAbilities|DESC:A master of Leaping Fire may enhance his or her metabolism. This means the user may add a Move-Equivalent Action in any given round by spending 2 Power or gain a +4 bonus to Initiative for the same price. For 3 Power they may Haste themselves for 3d4 rounds. On a lesser level, it can induce rapid healing, allowing the user to heal 1d4 + ~ Con Mod hit points per round for 5 rounds for 1 Power. Eliminating fatigue costs 1 Power and eliminating exhaustion costs 3.
ABILITY:Advanced Witchcraft Ability|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:The Path of Earth ~ Rushing Blood|TYPE:Paths.WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAdvancedAbilities|DESC:This special variant of Body Fuel allow the Witch to expend both attribute points and hit points to gain extra Power points. All damage taken in this manner must be healed naturally, as the mystic fuel is not easily restored. Each attribute point or 3 hit points so burned becomes 2 Power.
ABILITY:Advanced Witchcraft Ability|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:The Path of Air ~ Spirit of the Sage|TYPE:Paths.WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAdvancedAbilities|DESC:The character gains a limited version of Hysteria ~ +6 Intelligence, which requires 1 Power every 10 minutes of use.
ABILITY:Advanced Witchcraft Ability|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:The Path of Earth ~ Bones of Iron|TYPE:Paths.WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAdvancedAbilities|DESC:Some Witches call the strength of the Earth into their bodies, enhancing them in a wide variety of ways. The simplest technique knits bone and sinew together more strongly, adding 6d4 temporary hit points for 4 Power. Unfortunately, these may not be renewed until the duration runs out. The Iron Fist variant allows the user to treat his or her fists as maces, through which he or she may also channel Infliction as a Free Action when he or she strikes an enemy once per round. This costs 2 Power. The Iron Skin variant allows the user to gain +4 Natural Armor for 1 Power. The Iron Lung variant suspends the user's metabolism, briefly eliminating the user's need to breathe, stopping any poisons or bleeding, and making the Witch impervious to pain. This increases Fort saves by +4. The Iron Flesh technique provides a +2 enhancement bonus to the users Str and Con for 2 Power. All these effects last for 10 minutes and are notcumulative with themselves. The Witch may activate one per round as a Free Action.
