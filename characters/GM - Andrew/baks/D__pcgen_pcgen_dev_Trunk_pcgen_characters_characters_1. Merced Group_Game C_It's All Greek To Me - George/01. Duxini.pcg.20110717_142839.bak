ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Duties (+2)|APPLIEDTO:Venerate the Gods and maintain the ways|TYPE:Character Creation.CharCreation.General|DESC:(+2) A character with Duties has extensive obligations. These restrict his or her time and freedom of action, as well as draining his or her resources, but also mean getting a lot of practice or extra training. This typically includes Druids, Clerics, and Paladins. Ignoring your duties brings on various penalties. Strangely, this continues until the GM feels you have enough penalties to equal the points you got from Duties.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Occult Skill ~ Psychic Ability|TYPE:Extra.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:You have the potential to acquire psychic feats and skills.

ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Luck|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:A lucky character may either "Take 20" in advance, without taking extra time and whether or not this would usually be allowed, or reroll after the primary roll once per day. Most characters also get Bonus Uses.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Mana|APPLIEDTO:|TYPE:General.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:Every level of this ability taken grants an extra 1d6 points of personal Mana, 2d4 generic spell levels, or 3d6 Power. Characters without other psychic abilities do not become vulnerable to psychic attack modes if the game's current rules make psychics more vulnerable to each other. Mana can help with spellcasting, while Power often fuels meditative or martial arts abilities aside from psychic powers. Unfortunately, while Mana is extremely flexible, it recovers at a mere one point per day, two with rest and meditation. Power and generic spell levels recover each day, as usual. As a general rule, 1 point of Mana equates to 2 spell levels or 4 Psionic Power - or one charge from a magic item. Mana is commonly used to power exotic abilities. Abilities which would normally be uses-per day may be designated as using personal Mana instead at 1 use for 2 Mana. If Mana is required as an extra limitation, such powers usually count as Corrupted. Any character with Mana may select one of the forms of Natural Magic described below at no cost. Adding additional forms costs +6 CP each.

Select four related (i.e., get your GM's permission) skills, which you learn for half price. Each rank of a relevant skill now costs only 1/2 CP. Each rank of an irrelevant one now costs only 1 CP. ! You may take this ability twice, affecting two groups of skills, if your Game Master gives you permission. Adept is actually one of the most powerful abilities in the system. It provides a huge skill bonus in exchange for simply deciding on what you're good at. The Game Master should keep a careful eye this. It's most common in Prestige Class conversion.

The character must pay twice the normal experience point cost to create said item.

You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller, thin, fat, or in between. You cannot change your body type. Otherwise, the extent of the apparent change is up to you. You could add or obscure a minor feature or look like an entirely different person. The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form, nor does it alter the perceived tactile (touch) or audible (sound) properties of you or your equipment. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on the Disguise check. A creature that interacts with the glamer gets a Will save to recognize it as an illusion.

ABILITY:Natural Magic Choice|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Mana ~ Reality Editing|TYPE:NaturalMagicChoice.EclipseAbilityOutput|DESC:You may spend Mana to add details to the setting the GM has described. A minor detail consistent with the setting (say, a convenient tapestry or chandelier in the castle hall) costs 1-3 Mana. Notable, but plausible, additions (say a weak link in the chains or a handy display of weapons on a castle wall) cost 3-5. Major, unlikely, additions (a handy secret passage in your palace, a rescue party showing up two days early) cost 5-10 if the GM opts to allow them at all. Reality editing is always subject to GM approval. GM's who are quick-thinking and extremely flexible may opt to allow Grandiose additions. Be warned; even at a cost of 9-15 Mana this has the effect of turning over much of the plot and mood of the game to the players.
