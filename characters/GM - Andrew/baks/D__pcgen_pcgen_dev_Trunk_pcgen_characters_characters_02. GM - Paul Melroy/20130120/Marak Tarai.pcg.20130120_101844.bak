ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Duties (+2)|APPLIEDTO:TBD|TYPE:Character Creation.CharCreation.General|DESC:(+2) A character with Duties has extensive obligations. These restrict his or her time and freedom of action, as well as draining his or her resources, but also mean getting a lot of practice or extra training. This typically includes Druids, Clerics, and Paladins. Ignoring your duties brings on various penalties. Strangely, this continues until the GM feels you have enough penalties to equal the points you got from Duties.

Select four related (i.e., get your GM's permission) skills, which you learn for half price. Each rank of a relevant skill now costs only 1/2 CP. Each rank of an irrelevant one now costs only 1 CP. ! You may take this ability twice, affecting two groups of skills, if your Game Master gives you permission. Adept is actually one of the most powerful abilities in the system. It provides a huge skill bonus in exchange for simply deciding on what you're good at. The Game Master should keep a careful eye this. It's most common in Prestige Class conversion.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Save ~ Will|APPLIEDTO:,,,|TYPE:SavingThrow.Character Creation|DESC:Increases the Will Save by +1
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Leadership ~ Eclipse|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(6 CP). You have relatively obedient followers who are willing to follow your orders. By default they're of your general type, but with +3 CP and the Game Master's permission you may command an exotic race, undead, elementals, demons or other outsiders appropriate to your nature, or even (for another +3 CP) animated objects or other constructs. In any case, you gain followers with a total ECL of (2 x &lbracket;your level + your Cha Mod&rbracket;). While none of them can have an ECL greater than (your character level - 3) or less than 1, you may otherwise allocate levels, and describe their personality traits and areas of expertise, as desired. Their equipment is up to the GM, but is usually typical for NPCs. Their levels may be increased, or additional followers may be added, as you go up in level; the Game Master should make adjustments. While followers are not slavishly loyal unless the character truly deserves such loyalty, they are reliable within reason. Lost followers can be replaced as long as the character is making a reasonable effort to do so and isn't abusing his or her followers; this will usually require 2d6 months.

ABILITY:Disadvantages|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Disadvantage ~ Hallucinations Flashbacks and Visions|APPLIEDTO:TBD|TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter|DESC:Your version of reality doesn't always agree with that of those about you. While this is common enough with respect to details, in your case it may extend to things like whether it's daytime. More commonly, and most dangerously, you may simply see a distorted version of what everyone else sees. This is up to the GM, but the occasional Will save (DC 18) is suggested, or you may react in a radically different manner than those about you.
ABILITY:Disadvantages|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Disadvantage ~ Poor Reputation|APPLIEDTO:TBD|TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter|DESC:You're widely and unfavorably known. This results in a -6 penalty on "friendly" social skill and Charisma rolls throughout a major portion of the setting. This may be combined with "Outcast" in which case there's not much use in trying to talk to anybody. Even your companions will suffer penalties if it becomes known that they associate with you.
