ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Fast Learner (Specialized)|APPLIEDTO:Increased HD|TYPE:Character Creation.CharCreation.General|DESC:(+1) Actually purchased as a feat for 6 CP, this ability grants extra CP as the character rises in level. Specialized versions are available and encouraged. No one may take Fast Learner more than once unless it's been built into a template, race, or class by the Game Master.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Companion|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(6 CP). Used to gain familiars, psicrystals, animal companions, and sometimes mounts. Companion empowers a sidekick - usually an animal. You may choose to apply the standard d20 Druid's Animal Companion bonuses, Wizard's Familiar bonuses, Paladin's Mount bonuses, get a Psi-Crystal, or use any similar progression. The base creature may not have an ECL of more than 1/3 your character level.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Track|APPLIEDTO:Wilderness|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(3 CP). Characters with this feat select Urban, Wilderness, or Dimensional tracking. Tracking requires a Survival (for wilderness) or Gather Information (for urban) check every mile to follow the target. This is DC 15 for favorable conditions, DC 20 for unfavorable ones. Size bonuses on Hide checks apply, and unfavorable lighting may inflict penalties. Dimensional tracking relies on Spellcraft and can trace Gates or teleportation and dimensional travel.

ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Duties (+2)|APPLIEDTO:|TYPE:Character Creation.CharCreation.General|DESC:(+2) A character with Duties has extensive obligations. These restrict his or her time and freedom of action, as well as draining his or her resources, but also mean getting a lot of practice or extra training. This typically includes Druids, Clerics, and Paladins. Ignoring your duties brings on various penalties. Strangely, this continues until the GM feels you have enough penalties to equal the points you got from Duties.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Immunity / Living off the land|TYPE:EclipseAbility.Abilities.ShadowStuff.EclipseAbilityOutput|DESC:Minor Immunity/"living off the land", needs less supplies to get along then other characters.

This situation must be so specific as to make the ability rare and difficult to use.

Traceless characters leave no discernable traces of a particular type of activity. The user must choose a specific form. Common forms include - Travel means the character leaves no traces when moving about. The character leaves no footprints, disturbs no leaves, and breaks no twigs. Magic means the character leaves no aura behind and his or her magic does not leave a discernable trace. It does not help with enemies using direct divination or assessing his or her aura in person. Genetic means the character leaves no personal biological evidence, such as fingerprints or usable DNA. More exotic forms include Murder (the victim remains dead, but there is no discernable cause of death and no blood or other traces), Computer Hacking, Surgery, and many more. This may be taken multiple times, each time applying to another activity.

ABILITY:Disadvantages|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Disadvantage ~ Valuable|TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter|DESC:You are worth a lot of money.
