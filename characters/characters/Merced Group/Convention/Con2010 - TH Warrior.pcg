ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Duties (+2)|APPLIEDTO:|TYPE:Character Creation.CharCreation.General|DESC:(+2) A character with Duties has extensive obligations. These restrict his or her time and freedom of action, as well as draining his or her resources, but also mean getting a lot of practice or extra training. This typically includes Druids, Clerics, and Paladins. Ignoring your duties brings on various penalties. Strangely, this continues until the GM feels you have enough penalties to equal the points you got from Duties.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Save ~ Fortitude|APPLIEDTO:,|TYPE:SavingThrow.Character Creation|DESC:Increases the Fortitude Save by +%1&pipe;count("ABILITIES","CATEGORY=Special Ability","NAME=Save ~ Fortitude")

ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Grant of Aid|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(6 CP). You are automatically healed of 1d8+5 points of damage or 1d3 points of attribute damage or 1 negative level (select as needed) once per day per three levels or part thereof. This does not require an action; the player simply decides when it happens.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Stoic|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(6 CP). Characters with Stoic are not subject to death by massive damage and may make a Fortitude save (DC 15) each round to self-stabilize if below 0 HP.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Stoic ~ Improved|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(+6 CP) allows a character to survive until he or she reaches -30 hit points, although he or she still loses consciousness at 0 hit points.

ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Berserker|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(6 CP). The Berserker ability grants extreme but short-lived bonuses. The user normally gains +4 to two attributes, +2 to a saving throw or AC, and -2 to another attribute, save, or AC for (3+Con Mod) rounds 1/day. The user gains another berserk session per day per 3 character levels or part thereof. The user becomes fatigued after using Berserker. GM's should note that the character may not generally do anything else but a specified, focused task or similar stunt. For the classic barbarian rage, the character can do little except immediate, physical skills and tasks, mostly meaning combat. Note that the guidelines on where the bonuses should  go are not meant as absolute rules; let a character picksomething appropriate. AC, damage bonuses, to-hit bonuses, Caster Level, or even turning might all be acceptable choices depending on the character. The bonuses must simply total +8 (the character may apply a -2 penalty somewhere to add an additional +2).
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Weapon Prof ~ Any one Martial Weapon|APPLIEDTO:Greatsword|TYPE:Proficiencies.SpecialQuality|DESC:Grants Proficiency with selected weapons.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Fast Learner (Specialized)|APPLIEDTO:HD|TYPE:Character Creation.CharCreation.General|DESC:(+1) Actually purchased as a feat for 6 CP, this ability grants extra CP as the character rises in level.

ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Damage Reduction ~ 5|APPLIEDTO:Specialized for Physical Only (6CP)|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:This applies to all damage sources, including magical and energy-based attacks. Characters commonly specialize it by applying it only towards physical attacks, energy attacks, magical attacks, or another GM-approved specialty. The Corrupted modifier can be added by leaving an additional common "hole" in your defenses. For example, silver weaponry or fire spells would apply to physical reduction or magic defenses, respectively. ! You may take this ability multiple times. Each time, you add another type of damage reduction.
ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Berserker ~ Odinpower|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(+3 CP) usually increases the bonuses to +6, +6 and +3 respectively. The total increases to +13.

ABILITY:Character Points|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Expertise|TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable|DESC:(6 CP). A character with Expertise selects two related abilities, attributes, or other scores. He or she may reduce one of the selected abilities' bonuses at any time by up to -5 to add a equal amount to the other bonus. Usually, characters take this for Warcraft (BAB) and AC or damage, but many other combinations exist.

ABILITY:Disadvantages|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Disadvantage ~ Hunted|APPLIEDTO:The Enemy|TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter|DESC:Someone's out to get you. You may be an outlaw, have personal enemies, or have been marked by some mystical entity. The nature of your foes should be decided in consultation with the GM. As a rule, you cannot simply confront your hunters and fight it out with them. They're either numerous, powerful, or secretive.
ABILITY:Disadvantages|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Disadvantage ~ Compulsive|APPLIEDTO:Confronts Challenges|TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter|DESC:You have some particular mania or "code of conduct" which influences everything you do. Likely compulsions include the classic manias (like Pyro- or Klepto-), an overwhelming love or hatred, greed, dedication to some peculiar goal, truthfulness, extravagent spending, or even virtue. Codes include things like Hippocratic Oaths or Chivalry. Characters that ignore their compulsions take a 20%% experience penalty.
ABILITY:Disadvantages|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Disadvantage ~ Valuable|TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter|DESC:You are worth a lot of money. This usually means that there's a reward out on you, but it may mean that you will bring a vast price on the slave market, have some mystic quality about you which makes you priceless to a mage, or, for truly exotic character races, that your body parts are extremely valuable.

ABILITY:Martial Art Techniques|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Special Ability|KEY:Martial Arts Skill ~ Reach|TYPE:MartialArtsOutput.MartialArtsSkill.AdvancedMartialTech|DESC:You add 5' to your Reach in combat. This usually represents lunging and darting in and out, but could be a mystical ability.
