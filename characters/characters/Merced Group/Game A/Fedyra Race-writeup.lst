[21:57] Andrew: Fedyra - Fey/Dragon Humanoids
[21:58] Andrew: Tied to a single location energy source, without it they cannot reproduce. I want them to be hardy, have properties inherent to both Fey and Dragons... a mix
[21:58] Andrew: And probably should weaken without exposure to this energy source
[21:59] Andrew: The concept for the convention game is the heroes (our party) must drive an evil that has driven them from this home, or else their race will cease to exist
[22:00] Paul Melroy: Hm. Well, being tied to a power source for some abilities is probably a corruption on those abilities. Humanoid, draconic, or shapeshifting like so many fey.
[22:00] Andrew: Limited shapeshift I'd think
[22:00] Andrew: Humanoid but may choose one single animal form to adopt
[22:01] Andrew: unless they upgrade to full Shapeshift
[22:03] Paul Melroy: Shapeshift with +4 bonus uses, specialized in a single form (6 CP). Fey illusion casting or other powers? Fey are often enhanced dex. 
[22:04] Paul Melroy: It's often easier, before going into specific powers, to hit a bit of evolution and what you want them to be like.
[22:05] Andrew: hence me asking for help... I'm not one to make races normally
[22:06] Andrew: Hybrid Fey/Dragon powers... hmm... descended from Dragon / Fey mating
[22:06] Paul Melroy: Any particular kind of fey?
[22:06] Andrew: The Dragon would be the Hardiness and a Con bonus...
[22:07] Andrew: or perhaps just Cha Bonus
[22:07] Andrew: For the fey, Dryads seem fitting to me
[22:07] Andrew: sans the lack of male counterparts
[22:08] Andrew: Dryads are tied to a location (specific tree) so transferring that to a site of power makes sense
[22:09] Andrew: I'm thinking try to keep it 31 CP for now... so the 2d6 HP bonus... +2 Resistance to Saves, +2 to Cha
[22:10] Andrew: Brain storming session here
[22:12] Paul Melroy: Very well. Magical abilities, probably varying among a set dryad/niad/oread and draconic type for ancestors. Linked with a particlur place of power. Ergo, some basic abilitiies and a couple of "pick so many from each" lists. For the basics there, Innate Enchantment. Probably without any particular defense against dispelling and antimagic since they are magical beings and such things probably ought to weaken them. 
[22:12] Andrew: yup
[22:12] Andrew: so they're abilities would be (Su)
[22:12] Andrew: their
[22:14] Andrew: sounds good... though what the pick abilities should be...
[22:15] Paul Melroy: Innate Enchantment would handle that initial bit easily. Lets see; 1400 for the HP, 1400 for the +2 Cha, 2800 (two differing save boosts to keep the level down, might use the morale boosts to get some other minor bonuses). 
[22:15] Andrew: nice
[22:18] Paul Melroy: Dryad: Bonus with bows, speak with animals, speak with plants (possibly), minor hypnotic talent. Oread: Natural Armor, boost strength, ability to identify stones, minerals, and gems or some sort of earth sense. Naid: Raise fogs and mist, sense currents and weather, resistance to acid, minor healing ability. 
[22:18] Andrew: nice
[22:19] Andrew: I feel like a record... cause I say the same thing over and over...
[22:19] Paul Melroy: Draconic talents: Minor elemental attack (probably Inherent Spell rather than Innate enchantment, most likely L2 single-target bolt twice per day, 6 CP), minor elemental resistance, possibly boost to strength or con (not supernatural, and thus far more expensive).
[22:19] Andrew: BTW, feel free to put this up on the blog once we finalize it
[22:19] Andrew: just give me some credit... :P
[22:19] Andrew: ;)
[22:19] Andrew: and I can find the right face...
[22:20] Paul Melroy: Individual dragonic powers... Hm. I'll have to pull out the monster manual.
[22:20] Andrew: heh, yeah...
[22:20] Andrew: you can pull out the 4e book if ya want too...
[22:20] Andrew: powers is powers... :)
[22:22] Andrew: yeesh, dryads got ugly in 4e
[22:23] Paul Melroy: Black: Swimming boost, ability to hold breath a long time. Blue: Shocking grasp, Ventroliquism, Faerie Fire or minor powers over light. Green: resistance to poisons.
[22:24] Paul Melroy: Red: Bonus to deceptions, fire resistance
[22:27] Paul Melroy: White: Minor ice powers of course. Brass: suggestion, linguistic talents. Bronze: enhanced skills, imbue weapons with enhancements. Copper: Illusion casting. Gold: Second form, some bonus spellcasting (probably Adept chart).
[22:28] Andrew: We going with a list, or we just trying to find a common denominator
[22:29] Paul Melroy: Oh, I was considering a pick-the-two-sides-of-your-ancestors-that-you-lean-towards approach. Adds a lot of variety to a single-race world.
[22:29] Andrew: hehehe
[22:29] Andrew: okay
[22:31] Paul Melroy: Presumption; the fey side was a lot more dominant, since they were humanoid. Why hybridization... Something wiped out the females of most of the non-fey races, and the dragons - unsurprisingly - won the resulting competition.
[22:36] Paul Melroy: Secondary presumption; a resource crunch. Presumably our "plague" did a lot of damage to crops and such, Ergo, most of the dragons wound up staying in humanoid form pretty much indefinitely for lack of food for their dragon forms. Also forced to work together to hold off the hordes. Did whatever caused this run its course - or might it come back, perhaps even now?
[22:36] Andrew: wasn't figuring a one race world... but hey cool idea
[22:36] Paul Melroy: Ah. I thought you meant all the characters would be of one race.
[22:36] Andrew: Just primarily an isolationsionist race
[22:37] Andrew: yes
[22:37] Andrew: the players for the convention game ARE all the same race
[22:37] Andrew: I also intend to pregen the characters
[22:37] Paul Melroy: Well, that notion would allow multiple isolated pockets of the various races.
[22:37] Andrew: much easier to hand a character with completed background then go through an entire creation process
[22:37] Paul Melroy: Oh yes. 
[22:37] Andrew: especially for an 6 to 8 hour con game
[22:46] Paul Melroy: Now, for secondary support, they'll need a couple of the items that most recently went up in the Noble Blooded template - the immunity to the XP cost of the Innate Enchantments and the stacking modifier. 
[22:46] Andrew: good idea
[22:47] Andrew: (I'm trying to finish the game convention submission)
[22:47] Andrew: limited to 30 words for the bookley
[22:47] Andrew: booklet
[22:47] Andrew: You are the last hope for your dying race. Defeat the evil that has claimed your ancestral home before time runs out and your people perish. Come join us for the adventure.
[22:48] Andrew: nothing like 30 words to sell a concept
[22:48] Paul Melroy: Yep. I always have trouble compressing the book discriptions down to something that fits.
[22:50] Andrew: hm Fedyra is popular in the foreign languages, but nothing gaming related
[22:50] Paul Melroy: Well, it is a differnt hat.
[22:51] Andrew: It was Feydra (Fey Dragon, and then I decided to mix it up a little more  
[22:51] Andrew: Fey-dra to Fed-yr-a
[22:51] Paul Melroy: (Just bad puns on my part - Fedora).
[22:51] Andrew: or Fey Deer a
[22:52] Andrew: hehehe
[22:52] Andrew: Whilst in Monte Carlo the Saint saves the life of Fallouda, the ex-king of Fedyra.
[22:53] Andrew: My people actually existed!
[22:53] Andrew: Darn those sneaky Fedyrians
[22:55] Paul Melroy: Now, they may need some racial drawbacks to hold the cost down. Any major psychological limitations or racial difficulties?
[22:55] Andrew: Well, without the power source, they're weaker, they can't reproduce and they're lifespan decreases
[22:56] Andrew: So, that is Dependent on a few different levels
[22:56] Andrew: Since they were driven off, they couldn't even store some power to travel around
[22:57] Andrew: Unique Appearance would be another good one
[22:57] Andrew: Something that sets them apart
[22:57] Paul Melroy: Harder on the active magics than the dragon-powers most likely.
[22:57] Andrew: and since they're "alien" in the mind set of both draconic and fey ancestory, it's fitting to give them either rituals (obligations) or (compulsive)
[23:00] Paul Melroy: Should cover it. That will let you have forty CP worth of abilities or so. 
[23:01] Andrew: Okay... so does this race sound decent?
[23:03] Paul Melroy: Intermediate power level, reasonable level of internal variation, needs a paragraph or so of background and motivation to avoid the "human in a mask" syndrome, but that's further development.
[23:03] Paul Melroy: Should do just fine.
[23:04] Paul Melroy: Especially for a relatively short game.
[23:05] Andrew: awesome...
[23:05] Andrew: well, I should put on Angel
[23:05] Andrew: thanks for the help Paul.
