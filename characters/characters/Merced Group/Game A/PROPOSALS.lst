1)  Ability to change HP per level in a single class
2)  Ability to assign skill points for a certain level dynamically
3)  Link a Variable from a Master to a "Companion" or vice versa
4)  CHOOSE:SPELL w/ other tag to Assign Spell to a Class
5)  Ability to Change "COST" of Ability

6a)  Extra Choice for selected abilities - Apply Ability -> Choose from x selections (Apply Selection Choice) add ability to add text to Ability.
Reasoning: I take "Warcraft" normally it would grant a +1 to BAB and has a COST of 6. However, if I take Corrupted and Specialized the COST is reduced to 2.

7) Ability to create an Ability... Can be accomplished in LST Editor. Need better interface.

### Need for certain Applications to work
8) Allow CHOICE/CHOOSE to have a selection when the COST is 0 and the POOL has 0

9a)	Sort by 'group'.
9b)	Sort by Ability Grouping and not necessarily by Alphabetical order
example: Eclipse has certain abilities as part of a group
Acrobatic
  Light Foot
Action Hero
  Action Hero Stunts
Deep Sleep
	Prophecy
	Angst
	Foo

9c)	We need to group things together without needing to add more OS Blocks

9 can be accomplished a few ways... Introduction of a new tag  SORTORDER:

SORTORDER:x|y|z

x = Alphabetical (A-Z)
x = Group (Group with
y = Ability Name or Letter/Number to follow
z = optional sort numbering system  


SORTORDER:LIST|Acrobatic

Prophecy	SORTORDER:ALPHA|Deep Sleep|1
Will be the 1st Ability listed after 'Deep Sleep'
Angst		SORTORDER:ALPHA|Deep Sleep|2  OR  SORTORDER:ALPHA|Prophecy|1
